# Airside systems – Rule 10-7  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23  
**Mandatory Rule:** True     
**Rule ID:** 10-7  
 
**Rule Description:** Baseline shall be modeled with the COPnfcooling HVAC system efficiency per Tables G3.5.1-G3.5.6.  Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block the cooling efficiencies (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4) shall be based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.     

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1 Equipment Efficiencies  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** Tables G3.5.1 and G3.5.2  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirAconditioningSystem data table

**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()  
2. get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b()

4. baseline_system_type_compare()    

**Manual Check:** None   

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**   
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`  
- Get list of hvac systems of type 5 and 6 that serve more than one floor: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b = get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b(B_RMR).keys()`  
- Get dictionary list of baseline zones and the associated HVAC systems: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_b = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area (B_RMR)`  
    - For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`  
        - Reset the zone aggregation boolean variable: `zone_aggregation_factor_undefined_and_needed = Null`  
        - Reset the efficiency_matches_acceptable_value boolean variable to FALSE: `efficiency_matches_acceptable_value = FALSE`   
        - Reset the modeled efficiency variable so if it is not defined for this hvac system it does not carry over from the previous system, if efficiency is not reported in the correct units for defining the baseline then the outcome of this RDS is fail: `modeled_efficiency_b = ""`  
        - Reset the capacity not defined variable to false: `was_capacity_not_defined = FALSE`  
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`  
        - Get list of zones that the HVAC system serves (this is to get the zone associated with sys 3 or 4 which is used later): `zone_list_b = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_b[hvac_b.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
        - Check if HVAC system is of type 1,1b, 2, 3b, 4, 5,5b, or 6, 6b AND that is does not serve more than one floor, if meets criteria then carry on otherwise outcome is Not_Applicable (systems 5 and 6 are required to only serve one floor hence systems found to serve more than one floor are excluded from this RDS): `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(hvac_sys_type_b, target_sys_type, true) for target_system_type in [HVAC_SYS.SYS_1,HVAC_SYS.SYS_1b, HVAC_SYS.SYS_2,HVAC_SYS.SYS_3,HVAC_SYS.SYS_3b, HVAC_SYS.SYS_4,HVAC_SYS.SYS_5, HVAC_SYS.SYS_5b,HVAC_SYS.SYS_6, HVAC_SYS.SYS_6b]) and hvac_b.id not in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b:`  
            Loop through each cooling system (there will only be one) and get the attributes of the cooling system(s) associated with this HVAC (e.g. efficiency, capacity, etc.) and determine if minimum efficiency requirements are met via Appendix G  
            - For each cooling_system_b in hvac_b (there will only be one, this loop is not needed): `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b.cooling_system:`   
                - Check if rated cooling capacity does not equal null, if it does not equal null then set the cooling capacity equal to this data element's value: `if cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`  
                    - Set cooling capacity equal to the rated cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity`  
                - Elsif, check that design cooling capacity does not equal null:`Elif cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`  
                    - Set cooling capacity equal to the design cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity`  
                - Else, set the was_capacity_not_defined boolean variable equal to TRUE: `Else: was_capacity_not_defined = TRUE`  
                
                - Loop through each of the efficiency_metric_types associated with the cooling system until FULL_LOAD_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_NO_FAN is found (this is the only metric in 90.1 2019 used for DX cooling). Get the associated value of the efficiency from the list of efficiency_metric_values associated with the cool_system_b : `For x in range(len(cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_types)):`  
                    - Check if the efficiency metric equals FULL_LOAD_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_NO_FAN: `if cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_types[x] == "FULL_LOAD_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_NO_FAN":`  
                        - Set the modeled efficiency to the full load no fan efficiency: `modeled_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_values[x]`  
                Based upon the system type and cooling capacity determine the efficiency that is expected to be modeled.  
                - Check if the system is system type 1 or 1b: `if baseline_system_type_compare(hvac_sys_type_b, HVAC_SYS.SYS_1, false):`

                    - Set the aggregation factor boolean variable equal to false since it does not matter in this scenario: `zone_aggregation_factor_undefined_and_needed = FALSE`  
                - Check else if the system is system type 2: `elif baseline_system_type_compare(hvac_sys_type_b, HVAC_SYS.SYS_2, false):`  
                    - Set expected_baseline_eff_b = 3.1:`expected_baseline_eff_b = 3.1`

                    - if was_capacity_not_defined equals TRUE (if this equals False then carry on with logic, if it equals true carry out the 2 lines below and then skip to Rule Assertions): `if was_capacity_not_defined == TRUE:`   
                        - Set most conservative efficiency (highest efficiency) equal to 3.6 from Table G3.5.1: `most_conservative_eff = 3.6`   
                    - if was_capacity_not_defined equals FALSE (if this equals False then carry on with logic, otherwise go to Rule Assertions): `if was_capacity_not_defined == FALSE:`   
                        - if the associated zone aggregation_factor != Null and the system type is 3 or 3b then divide the capacity by the number of zones, else leave the capacity as is: `if zone_list_b[0].aggregation_factor != Null and baseline_system_type_compare(hvac_sys_type_b, HVAC_SYS.SYS_3, false): total_cool_capacity_b = total_cool_capacity_b/zone_list_b[0].aggregation_factor`

                        - Check if the capacity is greater or equal to 65000 and the aggregation factor is not defined and that the system type is not system 5 or 6: if so, set zone_aggregation_factor_undefined_and_needed to TRUE, otherwise set it to false: `if total_cool_capacity_b >= 65000 AND zone_list_b[0].aggregation_factor == Null AND any(baseline_system_type_compare(hvac_sys_type_b, target_sys_type, false) for target_system_type in [HVAC_SYS.SYS_5,HVAC_SYS.SYS_6,]) == FALSE : zone_aggregation_factor_undefined_and_needed = TRUE`
