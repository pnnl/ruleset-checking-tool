2. get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b()

**Manual Check:** None  

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**   
- Get list of hvac systems of type 5 and 6 that serve more than one floor: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b = get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b(B_RMR).keys()`
    - For each hvac system in the the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
        Check that the hvac system type is applicable to this check
        - Reset boolean variable that indicates if the hvac system is type 3 or 4: `sys_type_3_or_4 = FALSE`
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is of type 1, 1b, 2, 3, 3b, 4, 5, 5b, 6, or 6b AND that is does not serve more than one floor, if meets criteria then carry on: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-1", "SYS-1b", "SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3b", "SYS-4","SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b"] and hvac_b.id not in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b:` 
            Get the attributes of the cooling system associated with this HVAC (e.g. efficiency, capacity, etc.)
            - Get number of cooling systems, there should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` 
            - Assign the cooling system object to a variable: `cooling_system_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0]`
            - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
            - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
            Based upon the system type and cooling capacity determine the efficiency that is expected to be modeled
            - Check if the system is system type 1 or 1b: `if hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-1" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-1b":`
                - Set COPnf_full_load_eff_b = 3.2:`COPnf_full_load_eff_b = 3.2`
            - Check else if the system is system type 2: `elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-2":`
                - Set COPnf_full_load_eff_b = 3.2:`COPnf_full_load_eff_b = 3.1`
            - Check else if the system type is 3, 3b, 5, 5b, 6, or 6b:`elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3b" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-5" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-5b" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-6" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-6b":`
                - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh: `if total_cool_capacity_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh: `elif total_cool_capacity_b < 135000 AND total_cool_capacity_b >= 65000: size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh: `elif total_cool_capacity_b < 240000 AND total_cool_capacity_b >= 135000: size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh: `elif total_cool_capacity_b < 760000 AND total_cool_capacity_b >= 240000: size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`
                - Else capacity is >=760,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 760Btuh`
                - Set the COPnf_full_load_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`
            - Else, system type is 4:`else:` 
                - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh: `if total_cool_capacity_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh: `elif total_cool_capacity_b < 135000 AND total_cool_capacity_b >= 65000: size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh: `elif total_cool_capacity_b < 240000 AND total_cool_capacity_b >= 135000: size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
                - Else capacity is >=240,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 240Btuh`
                - Set the COPnf_full_load_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_2,size_category_b)`
            This check directly below is because mismatches between expected and modeled cooling efficiency could be due to there being multiple hvac zones combined into a single thermal block for specific system types.
            - Check if system type is 3 or 4: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3b", "SYS-4]: sys_type_3_or_4 = TRUE`                                      
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: if COPnf_full_load_b equals full_load_efficiency_b and the number of cooling systems associated with the hvac system equals one then pass: `if COPnf_full_load_b == full_load_efficiency_b and num_cooling_sys ==1: PASS`
            - Case 2: Else if the number of cooling systems associated with the hvac system is greater than 1: `elif num_cooling_sys > 1: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED AND THEREFORE THE OUTCOME OF RULE IS UNDETERMINED."`
            - Case 3: Else if, if the system type is such that multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces could be combined into a single thermal block (applies baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4) and the baseline efficiency is required to be determined based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces then outcome is UNDETERMINED: `elif sys_type_3_or_4 == TRUE: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK IF THE BASELINE EFFICIENCY WAS MODELED CORRECTLY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES."`
            - Case 4: Else, fail: `else: FAIL`
