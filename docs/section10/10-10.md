# Airside System - Rule 10-10
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** False 
**Rule ID:** 10-10  
**Rule Description:** Where no heating system exists or no heating system has been submitted with design documents, the proposed building system type shall be the same system as modeled in the baseline building design and shall comply with but not exceed the requirements of Section 6.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR   
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 10 proposed column c.   
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem Data Group

**Applicability Checks:** None

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
   
    
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each zone, if both humidity schedules for the baseline and proposed are undefined then pass: `if humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 2: For each zone, else if the baseline humidity schedule is defined and the proposed humidity schedule is undefined then fail: `elif humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null: outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "Fail because a humidity schedule is defined in the B_RMR but not in the P_RMR."`
    - Case 3: For each zone, else if the baseline humidity schedule is undefined and the proposed humidity schedule is defined then fail: `elif humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null: outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "Fail because a humidity schedule is undefined in the B_RMR but is defined in the P_RMR."`
    - Case 4: For each zone, else if the baseline and proposed humidity schedules match: `elif schedule_mismatch == FALSE: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 5: Else, For each zone, humidity schedules do not match: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THERE IS A HUMIDITY SCHEDULE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE BASELINE AND PROPOSED RMRs. FAIL UNLESS TABLE G3.1 #4 BASELINE COLUMN EXCEPTION #s 1 and/or 2 ARE APPLICABLE"`
