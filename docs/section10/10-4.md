# ASHVAC â€“ Rule 10-4  

**Rule ID:** 10-4  
 
**Rule Description:** Baseline HVAC systems using fossil fuel shall be modeled using natural gas. Except where natural gas is not available for the proposed building site, propane shall be used as the heating fuel.  

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building   
**Appendix G Section Reference:**   
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**   None 

**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_fuels_modled_in_RMR()  

**Manual Check:** None   

**Rule Logic:**     
- Get list of P_RMR heating_fuels: `heating_fuels_p = get_fuels_modled_in_RMR(P_RMR)`
- Check if oil, other or propane are in the P_RMR: `if "PROPANE" in heating_fuels_p or "FUEL_OIL" in heating_fuels_p or "OTHER" in heating_fuels_p: oil_prop_other_p = TRUE`
- Else: `oil_prop_other_p = FALSE`
- For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Set boolean variable to FALSE: `fuels_other_b = FALSE`
    - Set boolean variable to FALSE: `fuels_natural_gas_b = FALSE`
    - Set boolean variable to FALSE: `fuels_electricity_b = FALSE`
    - Set boolean variable to FALSE: `fuels_propane_b = FALSE`
    - Set boolean variable to FALSE: `fuels_oil_b = FALSE`
    - For each heating system in hvac_b: `heating_systems_b in hvac_b.heating_system:`
        - Reset energy source variable: `energy_source_type_b = ""`
        - Get the energy_source_type: `energy_source_type_b = heating_systems_b.energy_source_type`
        - Check if the energy source is propane, if so then set boolean variable to true: `if energy_source_type_b in ["PROPANE"]:fuels_propane_b = TRUE`
        - Check else if the energy source is natural gas, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["NATURAL_GAS"]:fuels_natural_gas_b = TRUE`
        - Check else if the energy source is electricity, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["ELECTRICITY"]:fuels_electricity_b = TRUE`
        - Check else if the energy source is fuel oil, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["FUEL_OIL"]:fuels_oil_b = TRUE`
        - Else, set other boolean variable to true: `Else:fuels_other_b = TRUE`    
    - For each preheat system in hvac_b: `preheat_system_b in hvac_b.preheat_system:`
        - Reset energy source variable: `energy_source_type_b = ""`
        - Get the energy_source_type: `energy_source_type_b = preheat_system_b.energy_source_type`
        - Check if the energy source is propane, if so then set boolean variable to true: `if energy_source_type_b in ["PROPANE"]:fuels_propane_b = TRUE`
        - Check else if the energy source is natural gas, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["NATURAL_GAS"]:fuels_natural_gas_b = TRUE`
        - Check else if the energy source is electricity, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["ELECTRICITY"]:fuels_electricity_b = TRUE`
        - Check else if the energy source is fuel oil, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["FUEL_OIL"]:fuels_oil_b = TRUE`
        - Else, set other boolean variable to true: `Else:fuels_other_b = TRUE`  
- For each boiler in B_RMR, save boiler to loop boiler dictionary: `for boiler_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.boilers: loop_boiler_dict[boiler_b.loop].append(boiler_b)`
- For each fluid loop in B_RMR: `for fluid_loop_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.fluid_loops:`
    - Check if fluid loop is connected to boiler: `if fluid_loop_b in loop_boiler_dict.keys():`
        - Check if fluid loop is used for heating: `if fluid_loop_b.type = "HEATING":`
            - Add to list of applicable fluid loops: `fluid_loop_list = fluid_loop_b.extend(fluid_loop_b.id)`
- For each applicable fluid loop in fluid_loop_list: `For fluid_loop_b in fluid_loop_list:`
    - Get boiler served by loop: `applicable_boiler = loop_boiler_dict[fluid_loop_b]`
    - Reset energy source variable: `energy_source_type_b = ""`
    - Get the energy_source_type: `energy_source_type_b = applicable_boiler.energy_source_type`
    - Check if the energy source is propane, if so then set boolean variable to true: `if energy_source_type_b in ["PROPANE"]:fuels_propane_b = TRUE`
    - Check else if the energy source is natural gas, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["NATURAL_GAS"]:fuels_natural_gas_b = TRUE`
    - Check else if the energy source is electricity, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["ELECTRICITY"]:fuels_electricity_b = TRUE`
    - Check else if the energy source is fuel oil, if so then set boolean variable to true: `elif energy_source_type_b in ["FUEL_OIL"]:fuels_oil_b = TRUE`
    - Else, set other boolean variable to true: `Else:fuels_other_b = TRUE`  
- Get whether baseline heating fuel is electricity and natural gas: `if fuels_natural_gas_b == TRUE AND fuels_electricity_b == TRUE: elec_and_natural_gas_b = TRUE`

**Rule Assertion:**  
- Case 1: if the baseline heating energy source is natural gas then pass: `if fuels_other_b == FALSE AND fuels_oil_b == FALSE AND fuels_natural_gas_b == TRUE AND fuels_electricity_b == FALSE AND fuels_propane_b == FALSE: PASS`
- Case 2: elif the baseline heating energy source is electricity then pass: `if fuels_other_b == FALSE AND fuels_oil_b == FALSE AND fuels_natural_gas_b == FALSE AND fuels_electricity_b == TRUE AND fuels_propane_b == FALSE: PASS`
- Case 2: elif the baseline heating energy source is anything other than electricity, propane, or natural gas: `elif fuels_other_b == TRUE OR fuels_oil_b == TRUE: FAIL`
- Case 3: elif the baseline energy source is propane and there is natural gas in the proposed then fail: `elif fuels_other_b == FALSE AND fuels_oil_b == FALSE AND fuels_natural_gas_b == FALSE AND fuels_electricity_b == FALSE AND fuels_propane_b == TRUE AND "NATURAL_GAS" is in heating_fuels_p: Fail`
- Case 4: Else: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK IF SPACE HEATING FUELS WERE MODELED CORRECTLY IN THE BAELINE PER THE RULES IN SECTION G3.1-10 HVAC SYSTEMS."`
