**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building_segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR:`
    - Reset list of applicable HVAC: `applicable_hvac_list_b = ""`
    - For each hvac_b in the building_segment_b: `for hvac_b in building_segment_b:`
        - Reset zones served list: `zone_list_b = []`
        - Reset total hvac cooling capacity: `hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b =0`
        - Reset cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = 0`
        - Reset efficiency tracker: `cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b = 0`
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 5, 5b, 6, 6b: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b"]: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
        - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
            # Create dictionary with HVAC system id as key and the cooling capacity and efficiency as list values
            - Add to list of applicable HVAC systems: `applicable_hvac_list_b = applicable_hvac_list_b.Append(hvac_b)`
            - For each cooling system in the HVAC system: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Sum total_cool_capacity across the hvac system: `hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b = hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b + total_cool_capacity_b`                            
                - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
                - if the efficiency tracker variable equals 0 then set it equal to the efficiency, otherwise do nothing: `if cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b == 0: cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b = cool_full_load_efficiency_b`
                - if cooling eff does not equal zero and is less than previous (the tracker) set the tracker equal to current efficiency: `if cool_full_load_efficiency_b != 0 and cool_full_load_efficiency_b < cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b: cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b = cool_full_load_efficiency_b`        
            - Add to list with cooling capacity and efficiency: `hvac_b_cool_cap_eff_list = [hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b,cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b]`
            - Add to dictionary with hvac system as key and cool cap and efficiency as values list: `hvac_cool_cap_eff_dict_b[hvac_b.id] = list()`
            - Add the list of descriptors to a dictionary with the hvac id as the key: `hvac_cool_cap_eff_dict_b[hvac_b.id].extend(hvac_b_cool_cap_eff_list)`   
            # Create dictionary with HVAC system id as key and a list of zones served as list values, in addition create list of floors associated with building segment
        - For each zone_b in the building_segment_b: `for zone_b in building_segment_b:`
            - Get the floor number that the zone is associated with: `zone_floor_number_b = zone_b.zone_floor_number`
            - Add to the list of floors in the building segment, keep adding as the code loops through the zones: `floor_list_b = floor_list_b.append(zone_floor_number_b)`
            - For each terminal unit associated with each zone: `for terminal_b in zone_b:`
                - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for each terminal: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b = terminal_b.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
                - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b)`                
            - Convert the list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b associated with the zone to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b = list(set(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b))`
            - For each hvac_zone_b in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b: `for hvac_zone_b in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b:` 
                - Check if hvac_zone_b equals hvac_b: `if hvac_zone_b.id == hvac_b.id: zone_list_b = zone_list_b.append(hvac_zone_b)`
        - Add to dictionary with hvac_b.id as key and a list of zones served as values, start with empty list: `hvac_zones_served_dict_b[hvac_b.id] = list()`
        - Add to dictionary with hvac_b.id as key and a list of zones served as values: `hvac_zones_served_dict_b [hvac_b.id].extend(zone_list_b)`

    # Determine the number of floors each applicable hvac system is associated with and perform check
    - For each hvac_b in applicable_hvac_list_b: `for hvac_b in applicable_hvac_list_b:`
        - Reset the list of floors: `list_floors_hvac_b = []`
        - Get list of zones associated with the hvac system: `zone_list_b =  hvac_zones_served_dict_b(hvab_.id)`
        - for each zone in the list of zones associated with the hvac system add to list of the floor names: `for zone_b in zone_list_b:`
            - Add to list of floors: `list_floors_hvac_b = list_floors_hvac_b.append(zone_b.floor_name)`
        - Get number of unique values (which will equal the number of floors): `num_floors_hvac_b = len(set(list_floors_hvac_b))`
        - Get list with cool cap (Btuh) and modeled cooling eff (COPnf) for hvac_b: `cap_eff_list_hvac_b = hvac_cool_cap_eff_dict_b[hvac_b.id]`
        - Get the efficiency that was modeled for the hvac system, COPnfcooling: `full_load_efficiency_b = cap_eff_list_hvac_b[1]`
        - Determine the capacity (Btuh) that should be used to determine the modeled baseline COPnfcooling efficiency: `cool_cap_hvac_b = cap_eff_list_hvac_b[0]/num_floors_hvac_b`
        - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b_b < 135000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 240000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 135000 : size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 760000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 240000 : size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`

        - Set the COPnf_full_load_expected_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_expected_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is pass if the COPnf_full_load_expected_b equals full_load_efficiency_b: `if full_load_efficiency_b == COPnf_full_load_expected_b: PASS`
