**Manual Check:** None.  
 
## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- Get dictionary with hvac system ids serving more than one floor as keys and the number of floors served as values: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b = get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b(B_RMR)`
- Get list of hvac systems of type 5 and 6 that serve more than one floor: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b.keys()`
- For each hvac_b in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in the B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`     
    - Check if hvac_b is in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b (outcome is Not Applicable for all HVAC systems not in this list): `if hvac_b in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b:`  
        - Get the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `num_floors_hvac_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b[hvac_b.id]`
        - Reset the efficiency found variable to false, if efficiency is not reported in the correct units for defining the baseline then the outcome of this RDS is fail: `was_efficiency_found = FALSE`
        - Reset the capacity not defined variable to false: `was_capacity_not_defined = FALSE`
        Loop through each and get the attributes of the cooling system(s) associated with this HVAC (e.g. efficiency, capacity, etc.)
        - For each cooling_system_b in hvac_b: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b.cooling_system:`
            - Check if rated cooling capacity does not equal null, if it does not equal null then set the cooling capacity equal to this data element's value: `if cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`
                - Set cooling capacity equal to the rated cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity`
            - Else if, check that design cooling capacity does not equal null:`Elif cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`  
                - Set cooling capacity equal to the design cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity`
            - Else, set the was_capacity_not_defined boolean variable equal to TRUE: `Else: was_capacity_not_defined = TRUE`
            - Loop through each of the efficiency_metric_types associated with the cooling system until FULL_LOAD_EFFICIENCY_NO_FAN is found (this is the only metric in 90.1 2019 used for DX cooling). Get the associated value of the efficiency from the list of efficiency_metric_values associated with the cool_system_b : `For x in range(len(cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_types)):`
                - Check if the efficiency metric equals FULL_LOAD_EFFICIENCY_NO_FAN: `if cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_types[x] == "FULL_LOAD_EFFICIENCY_NO_FAN":` 
                    - Set the full load no fan efficiency: `modeled_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_values[x]`
                    - Set the efficiency found boolean variable to TRUE (if never found outcome to RDS is fail): `was_efficiency_found = TRUE`
                - Else, do nothing and move on to the next metric: `Else:`     
            - if was_capacity_not_defined equals TRUE (if this equals False then carry on with logic, if it equals true carry out the 2 lines below and then skip to Rule Assertion): `if was_capacity_not_defined == TRUE:`
                - Set most conservative efficiency (highest efficiency) equal to 3.6 from Table G3.5.1: `most_conservative_eff = 3.6`
                - Check if the modeled efficiency equals the most conservative by using the RCT compare_standard_val function, Permit_More_Stringent_Value is defined globally and is TRUE OR FALSE: `capacity_not_defined_and_meets_most_conserv_eff_b = compare_standard_val(Permit_More_Stringent_Value, most_conservative_eff, modeled_efficiency_b, "greater than")`  func shall return True or False, "greater than" means that if the modeled_efficiency_b is greater than or equal to the most_conservative_eff it would be accepted if Permit_More_Stringent_Value equals TRUE   
            - Determine the capacity (Btuh) that should be used to determine the modeled baseline COPnfcooling efficiency based upon the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `cool_cap_hvac_b = total_cool_capacity_b/num_floors_hvac_b`
            Determine the expected efficiency to be modeled based on the rules of App G and the size of the system
            - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
            - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 135000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
            - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 240000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 135000 : size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
            - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 760000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 240000 : size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`
            - Else capacity is >=760,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 760Btuh`
            - Set the COPnf_full_load_expected_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_expected_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`  
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is pass if the modeled efficiency is as expected (compare_standard_val func shall return True or False, "greater than" means that if the modeled_efficiency_b is greater than or equal to the COPnf_full_load_expected_b it would be accepted if Permit_More_Stringent_Value equals TRUE ) and was_efficiency_found equals True and the capacity was defined: `if compare_standard_val(Permit_More_Stringent_Value, COPnf_full_load_expected_b, modeled_efficiency_b, "greater than") == TRUE and was_efficiency_found == TRUE and was_capacity_not_defined == FALSE: PASS`
            - Case 2: Elif capacity was not defined but the modeled efficiency meets the highest (most conservative) efficiency in the appropriate table based on system type then pass: `elif was_capacity_not_defined == TRUE AND capacity_not_defined_and_meets_most_conserv_eff_b ==  TRUE: PASS`  
            - Case 3: Elif capacity was not defined and efficiency does not equal the highest (most conservative) efficiency in the appropriate table based on system type then UNDETERMINED: `elif was_capacity_not_defined == TRUE AND capacity_not_defined_and_meets_most_conserv_eff_b ==  FALSE: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "Check if the modeled baseline DX cooling efficiency was established correctly based upon equipment capacity and type."` 
            - Case 4:Else: `Else: FAIL`
