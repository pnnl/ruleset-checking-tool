# Airside systems – Rule 10-9  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** True     
**Rule ID:** 10-9  
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block, baseline HVAC System Types 5 or 6 efficiencies shall be based on the cooling equipment capacity of a single floor.  

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                             
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 5 or 6 that include more than one floor.  

**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b()
3. baseline_system_type_compare()
3. compare_standard_val () (compare_standard_val func shall return True or False, "greater than" as the last argument means that if the modeled efficiency (third argument) is greater than or equal to the expected baseline efficiency (second argument) it would be accepted and return TRUE if Permit_More_Stringent_Value (defined globally) equals TRUE (first argument))  

**Manual Check:** None.  
 
## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- Get dictionary with hvac system ids serving more than one floor as keys and the number of floors served as values: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b = get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b(B_RMR)`
- Get list of hvac systems of type 5 and 6 that serve more than one floor: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b.keys()`

- check if there is at least one applicable HVAC system.  If so, continue with setup: `if len(hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b) > 0:`
    - Set most conservative efficiency (highest efficiency) equal to the efficiency for < 65,000 btu/hr, then go through each capacity category and reset it higher if there is a higher value: `most_conservative_eff = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,65Btuh)`
		- check if the efficiency for <135,000 Btuh category is higher than most_conservative_eff, if so, set most_conservative_eff to this value: `if data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,65_135Btuh) > most_conservative_eff: most_conservative_eff = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,65_135Btuh)`
		- check if the efficiency for <240,000 Btuh category is higher than most_conservative_eff, if so, set most_conservative_eff to this value: `if data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,135_240Btuh) > most_conservative_eff: most_conservative_eff = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,135_240Btuh)`
		- check if the efficiency for <760,000 Btuh category is higher than most_conservative_eff, if so, set most_conservative_eff to this value: `if data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,240_760Btuh) > most_conservative_eff: most_conservative_eff = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,240_760Btuh)`
		- check if the efficiency for <760,000 Btuh category is higher than most_conservative_eff, if so, set most_conservative_eff to this value: `if data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,760Btuh) > most_conservative_eff: most_conservative_eff = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,760Btuh)`
	
- For each hvac_b in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in the B_RMR...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`     
    - Check if hvac_b is in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b (outcome is Not Applicable for all HVAC systems not in this list): `if hvac_b in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b:`  
        - Get the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `num_floors_hvac_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b[hvac_b.id]`
        - Reset the modeled efficiency variable so if it is not defined for this hvac system it does not carry over from the previous system, if efficiency is not reported in the correct units for defining the baseline then the outcome of this RDS is fail: `modeled_efficiency_b = ""`
        - Reset the capacity not defined variable to false: `was_capacity_not_defined = FALSE`
        Loop through each and get the attributes of the cooling system(s) associated with this HVAC (e.g. efficiency, capacity, etc.)
        - For each cooling_system_b in hvac_b: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b.cooling_system:`
            - Check if rated cooling capacity does not equal null, if it does not equal null then set the cooling capacity equal to this data element's value: `if cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`
                - Set cooling capacity equal to the rated cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity`
            - Else if, check that design cooling capacity does not equal null:`Elif cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`  
                - Set cooling capacity equal to the design cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity`
            - Else, set the was_capacity_not_defined boolean variable equal to TRUE: `Else: was_capacity_not_defined = TRUE`
            - Loop through each of the efficiency_metric_types associated with the cooling system until FULL_LOAD_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_NO_FAN is found (this is the only metric in 90.1 2019 used for DX cooling). Get the associated value of the efficiency from the list of efficiency_metric_values associated with the cool_system_b : `For x in range(len(cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_types)):`
                - Check if the efficiency metric equals FULL_LOAD_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_NO_FAN: `if cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_types[x] == "FULL_LOAD_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_NO_FAN":` 
                    - Set the full load no fan efficiency: `modeled_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.efficiency_metric_values[x]`
                - Else, do nothing and move on to the next metric: `Else:`     
            - if capacity was defined: `if was_capacity_not_defined == FALSE:`  
                - Determine the capacity (Btuh) that should be used to determine the modeled baseline COPnfcooling efficiency based upon the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `cool_cap_hvac_b = total_cool_capacity_b/num_floors_hvac_b`
                Determine the expected efficiency to be modeled based on the rules of App G and the size of the system
                - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 135000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 240000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 135000 : size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 760000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 240000 : size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`
                - Else capacity is >=760,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 760Btuh`
                - Set the COPnf_full_load_expected_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_expected_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`  
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is pass if the modeled efficiency is as expected and the capacity was defined: `if modeled_efficiency_b == COPnf_full_load_expected_b and not was_capacity_not_defined: PASS`
				Conservative comparison: `if AHJ_RA_compare TRUE AND modeled_efficiency_b >= Conservative comparison: `if AHJ_RA_compare == TRUE AND modeled_efficiency_b >= expected_baseline_eff_b AND not was_capacity_not_defined: PASS` AND not was_capacity_not_defined: PASS`
            - Case 2: Elif capacity was not defined but the modeled efficiency meets the highest (most conservative) efficiency in the appropriate table based on system type then UNDETERMINED - this is only pass if AHJ_RA_compare == TRUE: `elif was_capacity_not_defined AND modeled_efficiency_b >= COPnf_full_load_expected_b: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "Check if the modeled baseline DX cooling efficiency was established correctly based upon equipment capacity and type."` 
				Conservative comparison: `if AHJ_RA_compare AND was_capacity_not_defined AND modeled_efficiency_b >= COPnf_full_load_expected_b: PASS"
            - Case 3: Elif capacity was not defined and efficiency does not equal the highest (most conservative) efficiency in the appropriate table based on system type then UNDETERMINED: `elif was_capacity_not_defined AND modeled_efficiency_b < COPnf_full_load_expected_b: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "Check if the modeled baseline DX cooling efficiency was established correctly based upon equipment capacity and type."` 
            - Case 4:Else: `Else: FAIL`
