**Function Call:** 

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_list_of_zones_per_hvac_sys_b()

**Manual Check:** None.  
 
**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building_segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR..BuildingSegment:`
    - Reset list of applicable HVAC (HVAC systems that are of type 5, 5b, 6, 6b ): `applicable_hvac_list_b = ""`
    - For each hvac_b in the building_segment_b: `for hvac_b in building_segment_b.heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_system:`
        - Reset zones served list: `zone_list_b = []`
        - Reset total hvac cooling capacity: `hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b =0`
        - Reset cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = 0`
        - Reset efficiency tracker: `cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b = 0`
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 5, 5b, 6, 6b: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b"]: hvac_system_type_applicable = TRUE`
        - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if hvac_system_type_applicable == TRUE:`
            # Create dictionary with HVAC system id as key and the total cooling capacity and efficiency as list values
            - Add to list of applicable HVAC systems: `applicable_hvac_list_b = applicable_hvac_list_b.Append(hvac_b)`
            - For each cooling system in hvac_b: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b.cooling_system:`
                - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Sum total_cool_capacity across the hvac system: `hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b = hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b + total_cool_capacity_b`                            
                - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
                # This pulls out the least conservative efficiency for all the cooling systems associated with the hvac system. There should only be one cooling system per hvac system so this is unlikely to be important.
                - if the efficiency tracker variable equals 0 then set it equal to the efficiency, otherwise do nothing: `if cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b == 0: cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b = cool_full_load_efficiency_b`
                - if cooling eff does not equal zero and is less than previous (the tracker) and cooling type does not equal None  set the tracker equal to current efficiency: `if cool_full_load_efficiency_b != 0 and cool_full_load_efficiency_b < cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b and cooling_system_b.cooling_system_type != "None": cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b = cool_full_load_efficiency_b`        
            - Add to list with cooling capacity and efficiency: `hvac_b_cool_cap_eff_list = [hvac_sys_total_cool_cap_b,cool_full_load_eff_tracker_b]`
            - Add to dictionary with hvac system as key and cool cap and efficiency as values list: `hvac_cool_cap_eff_dict_b[hvac_b.id] = list()`
            - Add the list of descriptors to a dictionary with the hvac id as the key: `hvac_cool_cap_eff_dict_b[hvac_b.id].extend(hvac_b_cool_cap_eff_list)`   
    # Determine the number of floors each applicable hvac system is associated with and perform check
    - Get dictionary with hvac system id as key and list of associated zones as values: `hvac_zones_served_dict_b = get_list_of_zones_per_hvac_sys_b(B_RMR)`
    - For each hvac_b in applicable_hvac_list_b: `for hvac_b in applicable_hvac_list_b:`
        - Reset the list of floors: `list_floors_hvac_b = []`
        - Get list of zones associated with the hvac system: `zone_list_b =  hvac_zones_served_dict_b(hvab_.id)`
        - for each zone in the list of zones associated with the hvac system add to list of the floor names associated with the HVAC system: `for zone_b in zone_list_b:`
            - Add to list of floors: `list_floors_hvac_b = list_floors_hvac_b.append(zone_b.floor_name)`
        - Get number of unique values (which will equal the number of floors) for the hvac systems: `num_floors_hvac_b = len(set(list_floors_hvac_b))`
        - Get list with cool cap (Btuh) and modeled cooling eff (COPnf) for hvac_b: `cap_eff_list_hvac_b = hvac_cool_cap_eff_dict_b[hvac_b.id]`
        - Get the efficiency that was modeled for the hvac system, COPnfcooling: `full_load_efficiency_b = cap_eff_list_hvac_b[1]`
        - Determine the capacity (Btuh) that should be used to determine the modeled baseline COPnfcooling efficiency (assumes the use of 1 floor): `cool_cap_hvac_b = cap_eff_list_hvac_b[0]/num_floors_hvac_b`
        - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 135000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 240000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 135000 : size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 760000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 240000 : size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`
        - Else capacity is >=760,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 760Btuh`
        - Set the COPnf_full_load_expected_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_expected_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is pass if the COPnf_full_load_expected_b equals full_load_efficiency_b: `if full_load_efficiency_b == COPnf_full_load_expected_b: PASS`
        - Case 2: Else then fail: `Else: FAIL`
