# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-9  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True     
**Rule ID:** 10-9  
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block, baseline HVAC System Types 5 or 6 efficiencies shall be based on the cooling equipment capacity of a single floor.  

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                             
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 5 or 6 that include more than one floor.  

**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b()

**Manual Check:** None.  
 
## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- Get dictionary with hvac system ids serving more than one floor as keys and the number of floors served as values: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b = get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b(B_RMR)`
- Get list of hvac systems of type 5 and 6 that serve more than one floor: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b.keys()`
- For each hvac_b in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b: `for hvac_b in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b:`
    - Get the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `num_floors_hvac_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b[hvac_b.id]`
    Loop through each and get the attributes of the cooling system(s) associated with this HVAC (e.g. efficiency, capacity, etc.)
    - For each cooling_system_b in hvac_b: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b.cooling_system:`
        - Check if rated cooling capacity does not equal Null: `if cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity <> Null:`
            - Set cooling capacity equal to the rated cooling capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.rated_total_cool_capacity`
        - Else, rated equals Null then set the cooling capacity equal to the design cooling capacity:`total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.design_total_cool_capacity`
        - Get the full load no fan cooling efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency_no_fan`
        - Determine the capacity (Btuh) that should be used to determine the modeled baseline COPnfcooling efficiency based upon the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `cool_cap_hvac_b = total_cool_capacity_b/num_floors_hvac_b`
            Determine the expected efficiency to be modeled based on the rules of App G and the size of the system
        - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 135000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 240000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 135000 : size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 760000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 240000 : size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`
        - Else capacity is >=760,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 760Btuh`
        - Set the COPnf_full_load_expected_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_expected_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`  
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is pass if the COPnf_full_load_expected_b equals full_load_efficiency_b: `if cool_full_load_efficiency_b == COPnf_full_load_expected_b: PASS`
        - Case 2:Else: `Else: FAIL`
