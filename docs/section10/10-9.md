# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-9

**Rule ID:** 10-9
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block, baseline HVAC System Types 5 or 6 efficiencies shall be based on the cooling equipment capacity of a single floor.    
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 5 or 6.

**Function Call:** 


**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC system cooling efficiencies, where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block (for baseline HVAC System Types 5 or 6), were modeled with a baseline efficiency based on the  equipment capacity of a single floor.  
 


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building_segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR:`
    - For each hvac_b in the building_segment_b: `for hvac_b in building_segment_b:`
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 5, 5b, 6, 6b: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b"]: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
        - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
            - For each cooling system in the HVAC system: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
            - For each heating system in the HVAC system: `for heating_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
            - For each preheating system in the HVAC system: `for preheat_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_preheat_capacity: `total_preheat_capacity_b = preheat_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load preheating efficiency: `preheat_full_load_efficiency_b = preheat_system_b.full_load_efficiency`                

            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED`
