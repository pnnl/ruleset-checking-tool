**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 5 or 6 that include more than one floor.  

**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b()

**Manual Check:** None.  
 
## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- Get dictionary with hvac system ids serving more than one floor as keys and the number of floors served as values: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b = get_hvac_systems_5_6_serving_multiple_floors_b(B_RMR)`
- Get list of hvac systems of type 5 and 6 that serve more than one floor: `hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b.keys()`
- For each hvac_b in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b: `for hvac_b in hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_list_b:`
    - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
    - Check if HVAC system is type 5, 5b, 6, 6b, if it is then carry on: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b"]:`
        Get the attributes of the hvac system related to this check
        - Get number of cooling systems, there should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` 
        - Assign the cooling system object to a variable, there should only be one and an index of zero is the first in the array so this should be the only cooling system associated with the hvac system.: `cooling_system_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0]` 
        - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
        - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
        - Get the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `num_floors_hvac_b = hvac_sys_serve_more_than_one_flr_dict_b[hvac_b.id]`
        - Determine the capacity (Btuh) that should be used to determine the modeled baseline COPnfcooling efficiency based upon the number of floors that the hvac system serves: `cool_cap_hvac_b = total_cool_capacity_b/num_floors_hvac_b`
        Determine the expected efficiency to be modeled based on the rules of App G and the size of the system
        - Check if capacity is <65,000 Btuh: `if cool_cap_hvac_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 135000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <240,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 135,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 240000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 135000 : size_category_b = 135_240Btuh`
        - Check else if capacity is <760,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 240,000 Btuh: `elif cool_cap_hvac_b < 760000 AND cool_cap_hvac_b >= 240000 : size_category_b = 240_760Btuh`
        - Else capacity is >=760,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 760Btuh`
        - Set the COPnf_full_load_expected_b variable using data_lookup: `COPnf_full_load_expected_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_1,size_category_b)`  
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is pass if the COPnf_full_load_expected_b equals full_load_efficiency_b and the number of cooling systems equals one: `if cool_full_load_efficiency_b == COPnf_full_load_expected_b and num_cooling_sys == 1: PASS`
        - Case 2: Else if the num_cooling_sys is greater than 1: `Elif num_cooling_sys > 1: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED AND THEREFORE THE OUTCOME OF RULE IS UNDETERMINED BECAUSE IT CANNOT ACCURATELY BE ASSESSED."`
        - Case 3:Else: `Else: FAIL`
