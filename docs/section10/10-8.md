# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-8

**Rule ID:** 10-8
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block the efficiencies (for baseline HVAC System Types 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10) shall be based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.   
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_baseline_system_types

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC system heating and cooling efficiencies, where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block (for baseline HVAC System Types 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 10), were modeled with a baseline efficiency based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.  
 


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building_segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR:`
    - For each hvac_b in the building_segment_b: `for hvac_b in building_segment_b:`
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 1, 1b, 2, 3, 3a, 3b, 4, 9, 10: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-1", "SYS-1b", "SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-4","SYS-9", "SYS-10"]: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
        - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
            - For each cooling system in the HVAC system: `for cooling_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `cool_full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
                **Rule Assertion 1:**
                - Case 1: For each applicable cooling system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED`
            - For each heating system in the HVAC system: `for heating_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
                **Rule Assertion 2:**
                - Case 2: For each applicable heating system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED`
            - For each preheating system in the HVAC system: `for preheat_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_preheat_capacity: `total_preheat_capacity_b = preheat_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load preheating efficiency: `preheat_full_load_efficiency_b = preheat_system_b.full_load_efficiency` 
                **Rule Assertion 3:**
                - Case 3: For each applicable preheating system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED`
