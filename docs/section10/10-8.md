# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-8  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** False   
**Rule ID:** 10-8  
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block the cooling efficiencies (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4) shall be based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.  

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1   
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 3 and 4.  

**Function Call:**   

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC system cooling efficiency, where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4), were modeled with a baseline efficiency based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.   

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each hvac_b in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
    - Check if HVAC system is type 3, 3b, or 4 then carry on: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3","SYS-3b", "SYS-4"]:`
        - Get number of cooling systems, there should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` 
        - Assign the cooling system object to a variable, there should only be one and an index of zero is the first in the array so this should be the only cooling system associated with the hvac system: `cooling_system_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0]` 
        - Get the total_cool_capacity: `total_cool_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
        - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_b = cooling_system_b.full_load_efficiency`  
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable cooling system where the number of cooling systems equals 1, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `if num_cooling_sys ==1:UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM COOLING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES."`
        - Case 2: Else, number of cooling systems does not equal one: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BE INVESTIGATED WHEN CHECKING THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM COOLING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES ."`
