# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-3  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.13    
**Mandatory Rule:** True     
**Rule ID:** 10-3  
 
**Rule Description:** For systems serving computer rooms, the baseline building design shall not have reheat for the purpose of dehumidification.  

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                            
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building   
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. The hvac system in B-RMR serves a computer room.  

**Function Call:**  

1. get_zones_computer_rooms()  
2. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()  

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Call function to get dictonary of zones that include computer rooms and associated square footage in B_RMR: `zones_that_include_comp_rooms_dict_b = = get_zones_computer_rooms(B_RMR)`
- Get list of the zones that include computer rooms: `zones_that_include_comp_rooms_list_b = zones_that_include_comp_rooms_dict_b.keys()`
- For each zone_b in zones_that_include_comp_rooms_list_b: `For zone_b in zones_that_include_comp_rooms_list_b:`
    - Reset does_zone_have_dehumification boolean variable: `does_zone_have_dehumification = FALSE`
    - Reset has_terminal_heating boolean variable: `has_terminal_heating = FALSE`
    - Get the hvac system associated with the zone (should only be one, this RDS assumes one HVAC system): `hvac_b = get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(B_RMR, zone_b.id)`
    - Check if the zone's maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule equals Null: `if zone_b.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule == Null: does_zone_have_dehumification = FALSE`
    - Else (i.e. if the zone's maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule does NOT equal Null): `Else:`
        - Loop though all elements in the schedule and check if the value equals 1 (convert to an 8760 schedule with a function if needed): `For x in Range(len(zone_b.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule.hourly_values))`
            - Check if the value does not equal one, if it does not then set boolean variable to TRUE: `if zone_b.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule.hourly_values[x] != 1: does_zone_have_dehumification = TRUE`
    - Loop through the terminal units associated with the zone and check if any have heating: `For terminal_b in zone_b.terminals:`
        - Check if the heating source is Null: `if terminal_b.heating_source == Null: has_terminal_heating = FALSE`
        - Else if, check if the heating source equals None: `elif terminal_b.heating_source == "None": has_terminal_heating = FALSE`
        - Else if, check if heating source does not equal none but heating capacity is 0: `elif terminal_b.heating_source != "None" and terminal_b.heating_capacity == 0 : has_terminal_heating = FALSE`
        - Else, it has terminal heating: `Else: has_terminal_heating = TRUE`

    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system (hvac_b above) if the zone served does not have dehumidification then pass: `if does_zone_have_dehumification ==  FALSE: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 2: For each applicable hvac system (hvac_b above) if none of the terminal units have heating then pass:`elif has_terminal_heating == FALSE: outcome == "PASS"`  
    - Case 3: Else (i.e. HVAC system that serves computer room space has dehumidification AND reheat): `Else: outcome == "FAIL"`
