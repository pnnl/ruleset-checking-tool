**Schema Version:** 0.0.18      
**Mandatory Rule:** True          
**Rule ID:** 10-14

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`  
    Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check based on system type  
    - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
    - Check if HVAC system is type 2, 3, 3a, 4, and 9 (else then the check is not applicable): `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4","SYS-9"]:`  
        - Reset the efficiency_matches_acceptable_value boolean variable to FALSE: `efficiency_matches_acceptable_value = FALSE`
        - Reset the efficiency found variable to false, if efficiency is not reported in the correct units for defining the baseline then the outcome of this RDS is fail: `was_efficiency_found = FALSE`
