**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()  

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check based on system type  
    - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
    - Check if HVAC system is type 2, 3, 3a, 4, and 9: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4","SYS-9"]:`  
        Get the attributes of the hvac system relvant to this check  
        - Get number of heating systems, there should only be one heating system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED: `num_heating_sys = len(hvac_b.heating_system)` 
        - Get number of cooling systems, there should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED for system 4. For system 4, heating efficiency depends on cooling capacity.: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` 
        - Assign the heating system to a variable: `heating_system_b = hvac_b.heating_system[0]` 
        - Assign the cooling system to a variable: `cooling_system_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0]` 
        - Get the total_cooling_capacity_b, for system 4 the heating efficiency is based on the cooling capacity, this assumes one cooling coil per hvac system.: `total_cooling_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)` 
        - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
        - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`    
        Determine the expected modeled efficiency based on the system type and capacity  
        - Check if the system is system type 2: `if hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-2":`
            - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 3.2:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 3.1`
        - Check else if the system is system type 9: `elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-9":`
            - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Ec, which equals 78% Et per PNNL PRM RM:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.78`
        - Check else if the system type is 3 or 3a:`elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3a":`
            - Check if capacity is <225,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_heat_capacity_b < 225000:`
                - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Et:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8`
            - Else capacity is >=225,000 Btuh: `Else:` 
                    Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Ec, which equals 78% Et per PNNL PRM RM:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.78`   
        - Else, system type is 4:`else:` 
            - Check if cooling capacity is <65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_cooling_capacity_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
            - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `elif total_cooling_capacity_b < 135000 AND total_cooling_capacity_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
            - Else capacity is >=135,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 135Btuh`
            - Set the expected_full_load_eff_b variable using data_lookup, Need to determine how to include both 47F and 17F efficiency values: `expected_full_load_eff_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_2,size_category_b,"47Fdb")`                                               
        **Rule Assertion:**  
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if number of heating systems equals 1 and the modeled efficiency equals the expected efficiency and the system type is 2,3,3a, or 9 then pass: `if num_heating_sys == 1 and hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-9"] and heat_full_load_efficiency_b == expected_full_load_eff_b: PASS`
        - Case 2: Else if number of heating systems equals 1 and the number of cooling systems equals 1 and the modeled efficiency equals the expected efficiency and the system type is 4 then pass: `if num_heating_sys == 1 and num_cooling_sys == 1 and hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-4"] and heat_full_load_efficiency_b == expected_full_load_eff_b: PASS`
        - Case 3: Else if, number of cooling systems is greater than 1 or the number of heating system is greater than 1 and hvac system is type 4: `Elif hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-4"] and num_cooling_sys > 1: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF HEATING AND/OR COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BE INVESTIGATED WHEN MANUALLY CHECKING THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED CORRECTLY ."`
        - Case 4: Else if, number of heating systems is greater than 1 and modeled efficiency equals the expected efficiency : `Elif num_heating_sys > 1 and heat_full_load_efficiency_b == expected_full_load_eff_b: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF HEATING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BE INVESTIGATED WHEN MANUALLY CHECKING THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED CORRECTLY."`
        - Case 5: Else if, if the system type is such that multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces could be combined into a single thermal block (applies baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4) and the baseline efficiency is required to be determined based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces then outcome is UNDETERMINED: `elif hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a"]: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "MANUALLY CHECK IF THE BASELINE EFFICIENCY WAS MODELED CORRECTLY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES."`
        - Case 6: Else: `Else: FAIL`
