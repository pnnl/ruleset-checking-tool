**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()  

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get baseline hvac system type dictionary: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Reset boolean variable that indicates if the hvac system is type 3 or 4 (used in rule assertion): `sys_type_3_or_4 = FALSE`
    - Reset boolean variable that indicates if the hvac system is in the smallest capacity bracket (used in rule assertion): `smallcapBracket = FALSE`
    - Reset boolean variable that indicates if the hvac system has 1 cooling and 1 heating system (used in rule assertion): `num_cool_heat_system_equal_1 = TRUE`
    Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check based on system type  
    - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
    - Resr
    - Check if HVAC system is type 2, 3, 3a, 4, and 9: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4","SYS-9"]:`  
        Get the attributes of the hvac system relvant to this check   
        - Get number of heating systems, there should only be one heating system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED: `num_heating_sys = len(hvac_b.heating_system)` 
        - Get number of cooling systems, there should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED for system 4. For system 4, heating efficiency depends on cooling capacity.: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` 
        - Assign the heating system to a variable: `heating_system_b = hvac_b.heating_system[0]` 
        - Assign the cooling system to a variable: `cooling_system_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0]` 
        - Get the total_cooling_capacity_b, for system 4 the heating efficiency is based on the cooling capacity, this assumes one cooling coil per hvac system.: `total_cooling_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)` 
        - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
        - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`    
        Determine the expected modeled efficiency based on the system type and capacity  
        - Check if the system is system type 2: `if hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-2":`
            - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 3.2:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 3.1`
        - Check else if the system is system type 9: `elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-9":`
            - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Ec, which equals 78% Et per PNNL PRM RM:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.78`
        - Check else if the system type is 3 or 3a:`elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3a":`
            - Check if capacity is <225,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_heat_capacity_b < 225000:`
                - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Et:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8`
            - Else capacity is >=225,000 Btuh: `Else:` 
                    Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Ec, which equals 78% Et per PNNL PRM RM:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.78`   
        - Else, system type is 4:`else:` 
            - Check if cooling capacity is <65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_cooling_capacity_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
            - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `elif total_cooling_capacity_b < 135000 AND total_cooling_capacity_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
            - Else capacity is >=135,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 135Btuh`
            - Set the expected_full_load_eff_b variable using data_lookup, Need to determine how to include both 47F and 17F efficiency values: `expected_full_load_eff_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_2,size_category_b,"47Fdb")`                                               
        
        - Check if system type is 3 or 4: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4]:` 
            - Set the system type 3 or 4 boolean variable to TRUE: `sys_type_3_or_4 = TRUE`
            - Check if system type is 3: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a"]:`    
                - Check if the capacity bracket is the smallest: `if total_heat_capacity_b < 225000: smallcapBracket = TRUE`  
            - Else (i.e. its system 4), check if the capacity bracket is the smallest: `Else: if size_category_b == 65Btuh: smallcapBracket = TRUE`
        
        - Check if either the number of heating or cooling systems is greater than 1: `if num_heating_sys > 1 or num_cooling_sys > 1: num_cool_heat_system_equal_1 = FALSE`
