**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()  

**Manual Check:** None  

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each building segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR..BuildingSegment:`
    - For each hvac system in the building segment: `for hvac_b in bulding_segment_b.heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:`
        Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check based on system type  
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 2, 3, 3a, 4, and 9: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-2", "SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4","SYS-9"]: hvac_system_type_applicable = TRUE`
        - Check if the system type is applicable to this check, if true proceed: `if hvac_system_type_applicable == TRUE:`  
            Get the attributes of the hvac system relvant to this check  
            - Get number of heating systems: `num_heating_sys = len(hvac_b.heating_system)` There should only be one heating system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED
            - Get number of cooling systems: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` There should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED for system 4. For system 4, heating efficiency depends on cooling capacity.
            - Assign the heating system to a variable: `heating_system_b = hvac_b.heating_system[0]` There should only be one and an index of zero is the first in the array so this should be the only heating system associated with the hvac system
            - Assign the cooling system to a variable: `cooling_system_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0]` There should only be one and an index of zero is the first in the array so this should be the only cooling system associated with the hvac system
            - Get the total_cooling_capacity_b: `total_cooling_capacity_b = cooling_system_b.total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)` For system 4 the heating efficiency is based on the cooling capacity, this assumes one cooling coil per hvac system.
            - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
            - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`    
            Determine the expected modeled efficiency based on the system type and capacity  
            - Check if the system is system type 2: `if hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-2":`
                - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 3.2:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 3.1`
            - Check else if the system is system type 9: `elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-9":`
                - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Ec, which equals 78% Et per PNNL PRM RM:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.78`
            - Check else if the system type is 3 or 3a:`elif hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3" or hvac_sys_type_b = "SYS-3a":`
                - Check if capacity is <225,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_heat_capacity_b < 225000:`
                    - Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Et:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8`
                - Else capacity is >=225,000 Btuh: `Else: 
                    Set expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.8 Ec, which equals 78% Et per PNNL PRM RM:`expected_full_load_eff_b = 0.78`   
            - Else, system type is 4:`else:` 
                - Check if cooling capacity is <65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_cooling_capacity_b < 65000: size_category_b = 65Btuh`
                - Check else if capacity is <135,000 Btuh and greater or equal to 65,000 Btuh then set capacity variable: `if total_cooling_capacity_b < 135000 AND total_cooling_capacity_b >= 65000 : size_category_b = 65_135Btuh`
                - Else capacity is >=135,000 Btuh: `Else: size_category_b = 135Btuh`
                - Set the expected_full_load_eff_b variable using data_lookup: `expected_full_load_eff_b = data_lookup(table_G3_5_2,size_category_b,"47Fdb")` Need to determine how to include both 47F and 17F efficiency values
