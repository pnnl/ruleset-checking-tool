# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-13B      
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23

**Mandatory Rule:** False  
**Rule ID:** 10-13B      
 
**Rule Description:** For proposed HVAC systems designed, mechanical preheating equipment efficiencies shall be adjusted to remove the supply fan energy from the efficiency rating.  

**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 10 b.  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. HVAC with mechanical heating.  

**Function Call:** None  

**Manual Check:**  

 1. Check that the mechanical equipment heating efficiency has been adjusted to remove the supply fan energy from the efficiency rating.   

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**   
- For each hvac system in the P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`
    - For each preeating system in the HVAC system: `for preheating_system_p in hvac_p.preheat_system:`
        - Check that heating system type is equal to heat_pump:: `if preheating_system_p.heating_system_type == "HEAT_PUMP":`
            - Reset no_fan_eff_entered boolean variable: `no_fan_eff_entered = FALSE`
 			- loop through each of the efficiency_metric_types associated with the heating system until HEAT_PUMP_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_HIGH_TEMPERATURE_NO_FAN is found (this is the metric in 90.1 2019 used for heat pump performance per table 6.8.1.4). Get the associated value of the efficiency from the list of efficiency_metric_values associated with the preheating_system_p: `for x in range(len(preheating_system_p.efficiency_metric_values)):`
				- check if the efficiency_metric_type equals HEAT_PUMP_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_HIGH_TEMPERATURE_NO_FAN: `if preheating_system_p.efficiency_metric_types[x] == "HEAT_PUMP_COEFFICIENT_OF_PERFORMANCE_HIGH_TEMPERATURE_NO_FAN":`
					- Check that the no fan full load heating efficiency does not equal Null: `if preheating_system_p.efficiency_metric_values[x] != Null: no_fan_eff_entered = TRUE`
				- Else: `Else: no_fan_eff_entered = FALSE`  

                    
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable heating system, if no_fan_eff_entered = TRUE then pass: `if no_fan_eff_entered == TRUE: outcome == "PASS"`  
            - Case 2: For each applicable heating system, else (no_fan_eff_entered = FALSE) then fail: `Else:  outcome == "FAIL" and raise_message "Per Table G3.1 section 10 b heating efficiency is required to be adjusted to remove the supply fan energy from the efficiency rating. A no fan full load heating efficiency does not appear to have been modeled for this heating system."`
