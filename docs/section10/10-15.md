# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-15

**Rule ID:** 10-15
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block the heating efficiency (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4) shall be based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.   
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 3 and 4.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC system heating efficiency, where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 or 4), were modeled with a baseline efficiency based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.  
 


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building_segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR..BuildingSegment:`
    - For each hvac_b in the building_segment_b: `for hvac_b in building_segment_b.heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:`
        # Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 3, 3a, or 4: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4"]: hvac_system_type_applicable = TRUE`
        - Check if the hvac system type is applicable, if true proceed: `if hvac_system_type_applicable == TRUE:`
            # Get the attribues of the hvac system relevant to this check
            - Get number of heating systems: `num_heating_sys = len(hvac_b.heating_system)` There should only be one heating system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED
            - Get number of cooling systems: `num_cooling_sys = len(hvac_b.cooling_system)` There should only be one cooling system - if there is more than one then the outcome of this RDS is UNDETERMINED. For system 4, heating efficiency depends on cooling capacity.
            - Assign the heating system to a variable: `heating_system_b = hvac_b.heating_system[0]` There should only be one and an index of zero is the first in the array so this should be the only heating system associated with the hvac system
            - Get the total_cooling_capacity_b: `total_cooling_capacity_b = hvac_b.cooling_system[0].total_cool_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)` For system 4 the heating efficiency is based on the cooling capacity, this assumes one cooling coil.
            - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
            - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system if system 3 and the number of heating systems equals 1, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `if num_heating_sys == 1 and get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a"]:UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES."`
            - Case 2: Else if, hvac system if system 4 and the number of heating and cooling systems equals 1, outcome is undetermined: `Elif num_heating_sys == 1 and num_cooling_sys == 1 and get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-4"] : UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES."`
            - Case 3: Else if, number of heating systems is greater than 1 and hvac system is type 4: `Elif num_heating_sys > 1 and get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-4"]: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF HEATING OR COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BE INVESTIGATED WHEN CHECKING THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES ."`
            - Case 4: Else if, number of cooling systems is greater than 1 and number of heating system is greater than 1 and hvac system is type 4: `Elif num_heating_sys > 1 and get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-4"] and num_cooling_sys > 1: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BE INVESTIGATED WHEN CHECKING THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES ."`
            - Case 5: Else, number of cooling systems is greater than 1: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE NUMBER OF COOLING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HVAC SYSTEM IS GREATER THAN ONE WHICH IS UNEXPECTED. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS BE INVESTIGATED WHEN CHECKING THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WAS MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES OR RESIDENTIAL SPACES ."`
