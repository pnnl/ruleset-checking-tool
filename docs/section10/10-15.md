# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-15

**Rule ID:** 10-15
 
**Rule Description:** Where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block the heating efficiency (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 and 4) shall be based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.   
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC system types 3 and 4.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC system heating efficiency, where multiple HVAC zones or residential spaces are combined into a single thermal block (for baseline HVAC System Types 3 or 4), were modeled with a baseline efficiency based on the  equipment capacity of the thermal block divided by the number of HVAC zones or residential spaces.  
 


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building_segment in the B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR..BuildingSegment:`
    - For each hvac_b in the building_segment_b: `for hvac_b in building_segment_b.heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:`
        - Get the hvac system type for hvac_b: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)]`
        - Check if HVAC system is type 3, 3a, or 4: `if get_baseline_system_types(hvac_b.id) in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-4"]: hvac_system_type_applicable = TRUE`
        - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if hvac_system_type_applicable == TRUE:`
            - For each heating system in the HVAC system: `for heating_system_b in hvac_b:`
                - Get the total_heat_capacity: `total_heat_capacity_b = heating_system_b.heat_capacity * CONVERSTION (W_TO_BTUH)`
                - Get the full load heating efficiency: `heat_full_load_efficiency_b = heating_system_b.full_load_efficiency`
                **Rule Assertion 2:**
                - Case 1: For each applicable heating system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT THE APPLICABLE BASELINE HVAC SYSTEM HEATING EFFICIENCY, WERE MODELED WITH A BASELINE EFFICIENCY BASED ON THE EQUIPMENT CAPACITY OF THE THERMAL BLOCK DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF HVAC ZONES."`
