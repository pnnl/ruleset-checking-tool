# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-15  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 10-15    
 
**Rule Description:** The proposed design includes humidification and the baseline building design has been modeled with humidification. 

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE                                              
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. The zone in the P-RMR includes humidification.

**Function Call:** 

1. match_data_element()
2. get_baseline_system_types() 
3. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()
4. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area()

**Manual Check:** For zones modeled with humidification in the baseline and proposed,check that the baseline system serving this zone is modeled with adiabatic humidification if the specified humidification system complies with 90.1 - 2019 Section 6.5.2.4, and that the baseline system serving this zone is modeled with non-adiabatic humidification if the specified system does not comply with Section 6.5.2.4. 
 
**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get dictionary list of proposed zones and the associated HVAC systems: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_p = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area (P_RMR)`
- Get dictionary for finding baseline system types for hvac systems: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
Get all systems in P_RMR with humidification specified and get corresponding list of zones served by those systems.
- For each HVAC system in the P_RMR: `For hvac_p in P_RMR...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`  
    - Reset hvac_has_humidification_p boolean variable to FALSE: `hvac_has_humidication_p = FALSE`  
    - Check if the humidification_type does not equal Null or None, if it does not equal Null or None then set the hvac_has_humidification_p boolean variable to True: `if hvac_p.humidification_type != Null and hvac_p.humidification_type != "None": hvac_has_humidication_p = TRUE`  
    - Check if hvac_has_humidification_p equals True, if it does then add the zones served to list of zones with humidification in the proposed: `if hvac_has_humidication_p == TRUE:`
        - Get list of zones that the hvac_p serves: `zone_list_p = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_p[hvac_p.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`
        - Add to list of proposed zones with humidification: `zones_have_humidification_list_p = zones_have_humidification_list_p.extend(zone_list_p)`
- Eliminate duplicates in the list of zones in the proposed with humidification: `zones_have_humidification_list_p = list(set(zones_have_humidification_list_p))`  
If humidification was modeled in the proposed for a specific zone, check if it was modeled in the baseline
- For each zone_p in the P_RMR: `For zone_p in P_RMR...Zone:`
    - Reset has_humidification_p in P_RMR boolean variable: `has_humidification_p = FALSE`
    - Reset has_humidification_b in B_RMR boolean variable: `has_humidification_b = FALSE`
    - Check if zone has humidification in the P_RMR, if it does then set boolean variable to true: `if zone_p in zones_have_humidification_list_p: has_humidification_p = TRUE`  
    Check if zone was modeled with humidification in the B_RMR 
    - Get analogous zone in the B_RMR: `zone_b = match_data_element(B_RMR,Zones,zone_p.id)`
    - Get list of hvac systems that serve this zone in the B_RMR, should only be one, note that this RDS assumes only one: `hvac_list_b = get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(B_RMR,zone_b.id)`
    - Check if the humidification_type does not equal Null or None, if it does then set has_humidification_b to True: `if hvac_b.humidification_type != Null and hvac_b.humidification_type != "None": has_humidification_b = TRUE`
    
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: If the zone was modeled with humidification in the baseline and proposed then Pass: `if has_humidification_b == TRUE and has_humidification_p == TRUE: outcome == "Pass"`
    - Case 2: Else if baseline zone is modeled with humidification when the proposed zone does not have humidification: `elif has_humidification_b == TRUE and has_humidification_p == FALSE: outcome == "FAIL" and raise_message "The baseline was modeled with humidification when humidification was not modeled in the proposed design model".`  
    - Case 3: Else if the baseline zone is not modeled with humidification when the proposed zone has humidification: `elif has_humidification_b == FALSE and has_humidification_p == TRUE: outcome == "FAIL" and raise_message "The baseline was NOT modeled with humidification when humidification was modeled in the proposed design model"`  
    - Case 4: Else, humidification not modeled for the zone in proposed or baseline: `Else: outcome == "NOT_APPLICABLE"`  
    
**Notes**
1. Based on the wording in Table G3.1 #10 baseline column, it means that if there was a scenario where one zone on a floor was served by a single zone system with humidification in the proposed, and a single system was required to be modeled per floor in the baseline that the whole system would have humidification. Not sure how many software tools would allow you to model humidification for just one zone. Maybe the assumption is that in this case G3.1.1 b would be triggered. The reason I thought about this is that maybe it is odd to be reporting this on the zone level.
