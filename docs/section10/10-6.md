# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-6
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** False   
**Rule ID:** 10-6
 
**Rule Description:** For HVAC systems designed, mechanical cooling equipment efficiencies shall be adjusted to remove the supply fan energy from the efficiency rating.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                            
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 10 b.  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each CoolingSystem data table  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. HVAC with mechanical cooling.

**Function Call:** None

**Manual Check:** 

 1. Check that the mechanical equipment cooling efficiency has been adjusted to remove the supply fan energy from the efficiency rating. 

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each hvac system in the P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - For each cooling system in the HVAC system: `for cooling_system_p in hvac_p:`
        - Check that cooling system type does not equal None:: `if cooling_system_p.cooling_system_type != "None":`
            - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.full_load_efficiency`
            - Get the part load cooling efficiency: `part_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.part_load_efficiency`  
                    
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac cooling system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed (in the message please provide the hvac_p.id, cooling_system_p.id,full_load_efficiency_p, and part_load_efficiency_p so that a manual check can be performed using this information): `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT THE COOLING EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REMOVE THE SUPPLY FAN ENERGY FROM THE EFFICIENCY RATING."`
