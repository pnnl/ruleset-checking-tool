# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-3

**Rule ID:** 10-3
 
**Rule Description:** For systems serving computer rooms, the baseline building design shall not have reheat for the purpose of dehumidification.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. The hvac system in B-RMR serves a computer room.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_computer_rooms

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC systems (hvac systems that serve comuter rooms) were modeled per the rules of G3.1-10 HVAC System baseline column which states that for systems serving computer rooms, the baseline building design shall not have reheat for the purpose of dehumidification.  
 

**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Call function to get list of applicable zones in P_RMR: `applicable_zones_comp_room_p = get_zones_computer_rooms(P_RMR)`
- For each zone in P_RMR: `zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - Check if the zone includes a computer room, if so then applicability flag is true: `if zone_p.id in applicable_zones_comp_room_p: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
        - If rule_applicability_flag = TRUE for zone_p: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
            - Get analogous zone ID in the B_RMR: `zone_b = match_data_element(B_RMR,Zones,zone_p.id)`
            - For each terminal unit associated with the zone_b in the B_RMR: `for terminal_b in zone_b:`
                - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for each terminal: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b = terminal_b.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
                - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b)`                
    - Convert the list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b associated with the applicable zones to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through all zones: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b = list(set(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b))`
    - For each hvac_b in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b: `For in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b:` 
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED`
