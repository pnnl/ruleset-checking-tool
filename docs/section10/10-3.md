# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-3  

**Rule ID:** 10-3  
 
**Rule Description:** For systems serving computer rooms, the baseline building design shall not have reheat for the purpose of dehumidification.  

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                            
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building   
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. The hvac system in B-RMR serves a computer room.  

**Function Call:**  

1. get_zones_computer_rooms()  

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC systems (hvac systems that serve comuter rooms) were modeled per the rules of G3.1-10 HVAC System baseline column which states that for systems serving computer rooms, the baseline building design shall not have reheat for the purpose of dehumidification.   

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Call function to get list of zones that serve computer rooms in P_RMR: `zones_that_serve_comp_rooms_p = get_zones_computer_rooms(P_RMR)`
- For each zone in P_RMR: `zone_p in P_RMR..Zone:`
    - Check if the zone includes a computer room, if so then set zone has computer room(s) boolean variable to true: `if zone_p.id in zones_that_serve_comp_rooms_p: zone_has_computer_room = TRUE`
    - If zone_has_computer_room = TRUE for zone_p: `if zone_has_computer_room == TRUE:`
        - Get analogous zone ID in the B_RMR: `zone_b = match_data_element(B_RMR,Zones,zone_p.id)`
        - For each terminal unit associated with the zone_b in the B_RMR: `for terminal_b in zone_b.terminals:`
            - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for each terminal: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b = terminal_b.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
            - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b)`                
- Convert the list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b associated with the applicable zones to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through all zones: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b = list(set(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b))`
- For each hvac_b in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b: `For hvac_b in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_b:`  
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "HVAC SYSTEM SERVES A COMPUTER ROOM AND THE BASELINE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT USE REHEAT FOR DEHUMIDIFICATION. THIS NEEDS TO BE MANUALLY VERIFIED."`
