# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-5

**Rule ID:** 10-5
 
**Rule Description:** For HVAC systems designed, mechanical equipment cooling efficiencies shall be adjusted from actual design conditions to the standard rating conditions.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 10 b. 
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each CoolingSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. HVAC with mechanical cooling.

**Function Call:** None

**Manual Check:** 

 1. Check that the mechanical equipment cooling efficiency has been adjusted from actual design conditions to standard rating conditions.  


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building segment in the P_RMR: `for building_segment_p in P_RMR..BuildingSegment:`
    - For each hvac system in the building segment: `for hvac_p in bulding_segment_p.heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:`
        - Reset cooling efficiency tracker: `cooling_eff_tracker = 0`
        - Reset rule applicablility flag: `rule_applicability_flag = FALSE`
        - For each cooling system in the HVAC system: `for cooling_system_p in hvac_p:`
            - Check that cooling system type does not equal None:: `if cooling_system_p.cooling_system_type != "None":`
                - Set applicability flag to true: `rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
                - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
                    - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.full_load_efficiency`
                    - Get the part load cooling efficiency: `part_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.part_load_efficiency`
                    
                    **Rule Assertion:**
                    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac cooling system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT COOLING EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FROM ACTUAL DESIGN CONDITIONS TO STANDARD RATING CONDITIONS"`
