# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-5  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** False   
**Rule ID:** 10-5  
 
**Rule Description:** For HVAC systems designed, mechanical equipment cooling efficiencies shall be adjusted from actual design conditions to the standard rating conditions.   

**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 10 b.  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None    
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each CoolingSystem data table   

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. HVAC with mechanical cooling.  

**Function Call:** None  

**Manual Check:**  

 1. Check that the mechanical equipment cooling efficiency has been adjusted from actual design conditions to standard rating conditions.   

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**   
- For each hvac system in the P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Reset cooling efficiency tracker: `cooling_eff_tracker = 0`
    - For each cooling system in the HVAC system: `for cooling_system_p in hvac_p:`
        - Check that cooling system type does not equal None:: `if cooling_system_p.cooling_system_type != "None":`
            - Get the full load cooling efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.full_load_efficiency`
            - Get the part load cooling efficiency: `part_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.part_load_efficiency`  
                    
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac cooling system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "CHECK THAT COOLING EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FROM ACTUAL DESIGN CONDITIONS TO STANDARD RATING CONDITIONS"`
