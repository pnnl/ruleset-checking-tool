# Rule Definition Development Strategy

### Introduction
The following documentation provides a technical description of ASHRAE 90.1-2019 Appendix G rules as defined in the ASHRAE 229P Test Case Descriptions (TCD) based on the construct of the Ruleset Checking Tool (RCT) Rule Definitions.  This document serves as a bridge between the ASHRAE 229 TCDs, which are in the form of the ruleset, and the RCT Rule Definitions, which are in the form of Python classes.  Each Rule Definition Development Strategy document seeks to describe a TCD Rule in pseudocode that can be understood by ASHRAE 90.1 professionals and Python developers alike.  The documents are organized based on 90.1 section and TCD Rule.  Front matter is included that describes any standard conventions, nomenclature or use of pseudocode functions.  The purpose of this document is not to provide direct Python code, rather to convey the logic necessary to develop code that meets the intent of the 229 TCDs.

### Notes on Evaluating Rules Separately for Buildings
Most rules documented in the RDS apply to data groups that are located within the *buildings* array.  It is typical that an RMR will only include a single *building* object.  In the case where multiple *building* objects exists in an RMR, each rule will be evaluated independently for each *building* object.  The following is a list of sections that will be evaluated for each *building* object in the RMR per the previous description: 
 - 5  
 - 6  
 - 12  
 - 16  
 - 17  

The *transformers* data group is handled differently, since the data group exists at the top level of the RMR schema.  For any rules related to distribution transformers, the rule is evaluated only the *transformers* list and *buildings* are ignored in the rule evaluation.  This is only applicable to the following section:
- 15  

These conventions are used in all RDS below, and the logic of evaluating rules for each *building* or *transformer* are not described in the individual RDS document.

  * [Functions](_functions.md): A list of functions used within the Rule Definition Development Strategy documents

## Ruleset Functions
  * [get_lighting_status_type](ruleset_functions/get_lighting_status_type.md): This function would determine whether the space lighting status type is 1). not-yet designed or match Table 9_5_1, 2). as-designed or as-existing.  
  * [get_opaque_surface_type.md](ruleset_functions/get_opaque_surface_type.md): This function would determine whether it is a wall, ceiling or floor.  
  * [get_surface_conditioning_category.md](ruleset_functions/get_surface_conditioning_category.md): This function would cycle through each surface in  a zone and categorize it as exterior res, exterior non res, exterior mixed, semi-exterior or unregulated.  
  * [get_wwr.md](ruleset_functions/get_wwr.md): This function would determine window wall ratio for a building segment.  
  * [get_zone_conditioning_category.md](ruleset_functions/get_zone_conditioning_category.md): Determine the Zone Conditioning Category for each zone. This function would cycle through each zone in an RMR and categorize it as ‘conditioned’, 'semi-heated’, 'unenclosed' or ‘unconditioned’.  If ‘conditioned’ it will also categorize the space as ‘residential’ or ‘non-residential’.  
  * [normalize_space_schedules.md](ruleset_functions/normalize_space_schedules.md):This function would determine a normalized schedule for a data element in space.
