# Boiler - Rule 21-18  

**Rule ID:** 21-18  
**Rule Description:** Baseline shall have only one heating hot water plant.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR LEN(FluidLoop.type == "HEATING") == 1  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.2 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B-RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Applicability Check:**

- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a, continue to rule logic: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-1", "SYS-5", "SYS-7", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-1A", "SYS-7A", "SYS-11.2A", "SYS-12A"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each fluid loop in B_RMR: `for fluid_loop_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.fluid_loops:`

  - Check if fluid loop type is heating, add to heating hot water loop count: `if fluid_loop_b.type == "HEATING": hhw_loop_count += 1`

**Rule Assertion - Component:**

- Case 1: If the total number of heating hot water loop in B_RMR is 1: `if hhw_loop_count == 1: PASS`

- Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Note:**

1. I was not able to find the exact language in App. G to put under the "Appendix G Section Reference".
2. This treats all buildings in an RMR (if it has multiple buildings) as one building with one HHW plant.
