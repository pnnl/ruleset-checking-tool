# Boiler - Rule 21-17  

**Rule ID:** 21-17  
**Rule Description:** All boilers in the baseline building design shall be modeled at the minimum efficiency levels, both part load and full load, in accordance with Tables G3.5.6.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.2.1 General Baseline HVAC System Requirements - Equipment Efficiencies

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. baseline_system_type_compare()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a, continue to rule logic: `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(sys_type, target_system_type, true) for sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for target_system_type in [HVAC.SYS_1, HVAC.SYS_5, HVAC.SYS_7, HVAC.SYS_11_2, HVAC.SYS_12, HVAC.SYS_1A, HVAC.SYS_7A, HVAC.SYS_11_2A, HVAC.SYS_12A]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`
  

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each boiler in B-RMR: `for boiler_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.boilers:`

  **Rule Assertion - Component:**

  - Case 1: For each boiler, if its rated capacity is less than 300,000Btuh, and its efficiency metric is AFUE, and its efficiency is 80%: `if ( boiler_b.rated_capacity < 300000 ) AND ( boiler_b.efficiency_metric == "ANNUAL_FUEL_UTILIZATION" ) AND ( boiler_b.efficiency == 0.8 ): PASS`

  - Case 2: Else if its rated capacity is less than or equal to 2,500,000Btuh, and its efficiency metric is thermal, and its efficiency is 75%: `if ( boiler_b.rated_capacity <= 2500000 ) AND ( boiler_b.efficiency_metric == "THERMAL" ) AND ( boiler_b.efficiency == 0.75 ): PASS`

  - Case 3: Else if its rated capacity is more than 2,500,000Btuh, and its efficiency metric is combustion, and its efficiency is 80%: `if ( boiler_b.rated_capacity > 2500000 ) AND ( boiler_b.efficiency_metric == "COMBUSTION" ) AND ( boiler_b.efficiency == 0.8 ): PASS`

  - Case 4: Else: `else: FAIL`

1. Updated the Rule ID from 21-19 to 21-17 on 7/26/2022
