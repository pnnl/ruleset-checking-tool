# Boiler - Rule 21-21  

**Rule ID:** 21-21  
**Rule Description:** For baseline building, fossil fuel systems shall be modeled using natural gas as their fuel source. Exception: For fossil fuel systems where natural gas is not available for the proposed building site as determined by the rating authority, the baseline HVAC systems shall be modeled using propane as their fuel.
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.2.1 General Baseline HVAC System Requirements - Equipment Efficiencies

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a.

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a, continue to rule logic: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-1", "SYS-5", "SYS-7", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-1A", "SYS-7A", "SYS-11.2A", "SYS-12A"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each boiler in B-RMR: `for boiler_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.boilers:`

  **Rule Assertion - Component:**

  - Case 1: For each boiler, if its fuel source is natural gas: `if boiler_b.energy_source_type == "NATURAL_GAS": PASS`

  - Case 2: Else if its fuel source is propane: `else if boiler_b.energy_source_type == "PROPANE": UNDETERMINED and raise_message "BASELINE BOILER FUEL SOURCE IS MODELED AS PROPANE. VERIFY IF NATURAL GAS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE PROPOSED BUILDING SITE AS DETERMINED BY THE RATING AUTHORITY."`

  - Case 3: Else: `else: FAIL`
