# Boiler - Rule 21-10  

**Rule ID:** 21-10  
**Rule Description:** When the building is modeled with HHW plant (served by either boiler(s) or purchased hot water/steam), the hot water pump shall be modeled as riding the pump curve if the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2 otherwise it shall be modeled with a VFD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a, 1b, 3b, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 11b, 12b, 13b, 1c, 3c, 7c, 11c, 13c.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_loop_zone_list_w_area()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`
  
  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a, 1b, 3b, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 11.1b, 12b, 1c, 3c, 7c, 8c, 11.1c, continue to rule logic: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-1", "SYS-5", "SYS-7", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-1A", "SYS-7A", "SYS-11.2A", "SYS-12A", "SYS-1B", "SYS-3B", "SYS-5B", "SYS-6B", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-9B", "SYS-11.1B", "SYS-12B", "SYS-1C", "SYS-3C", "SYS-7C", "SYS-11.1C"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- Get dictionary that saves the list of zones and the total floor area served by each CHW or HHW loop: `loop_zone_list_w_area_dict = get_loop_zone_list_w_area(B_RMR)`

- For each pump in B-RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.pumps:`

  - Check if pump serves heating hot water loop: `if pump_b.loop_or_piping.type == "HEATING":`

    - Check if heating hot water loop serves less than 120,000 ft^2, set target pump type to riding the pump curve: `if loop_area_dict(pump_b.loop_or_piping) < 120000: target_pump_type == "FIXED_SPEED"`

    - Else, heating hot water loop serves 120,000 ft^2 or more, set target pump type to variable speed: `else: target_pump_type == "VARIABLE_SPEED"`

      **Rule Assertion - Component:**

      - Case 1: For heating hot water loop, if the hot water pump is modeled as riding the pump curve when the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2, or modeled with a VFD when the hot water system serves more than or equal to 120,000 ft^2: `if pump_b.speed_control == target_pump_type: PASS`

      - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`
