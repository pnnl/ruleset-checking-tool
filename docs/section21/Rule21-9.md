# Boiler - Rule 21-9  

**Rule ID:** 21-9  
**Rule Description:** When baseline building includes boilers, Hot Water Pump Power = 19W/gpm.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11.2, 12, 1a, 7a, 11.2a, 12a, continue to rule logic: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-1", "SYS-5", "SYS-7", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-1A", "SYS-7A", "SYS-11.2A", "SYS-12A"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each boiler in B_RMR, save boiler to loop boiler dictionary: `for boiler_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.boilers: loop_boiler_dict[boiler_b.loop].append(boiler_b)`

- For each fluid loop in B_RMR: `for fluid_loop_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.fluid_loops:`

  - Check if fluid loop is connected to boiler(s): `if fluid_loop_b in loop_boiler_dict.keys()`

    **Rule Assertion - Component:**

    - Case 1: For heating hot water loop that boiler serves, if total pump power per flow rate is equal to 19W/gpm: `if fluid_loop_b.pump_power_per_flow_rate == 19: PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Notes:**

1. This rule does not check any pump power on heating loop that is not connected to boiler(s). If RMR has heating loop not connected to boiler(s), it will fail the one HHW loop rule.
