# Boiler - Rule 21-14  

**Rule ID:** 21-14  
**Rule Description:** When the baseline building is modeled with a hot water plant, served by purchased HW system, hot water supply temperature reset is not modeled.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.1.1 & G3.1.1.3.1 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.25

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. P-RMD is modeled with purchased hot water or steam.

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. check_purchased_chw_hhw()

**Applicability Checks:**

- Check if B-RMR is modeled with purchased hot water/steam: `purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict = check_purchased_chw_hhw(B_RMR)`

  - If B-RMD is not modeled with purchased hot water/steam, rule is not applicable to B-RMD: `if NOT purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_HEATING"]: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

  - Else, B-RMD is modeled with purchased hot water/steam, continue to rule logic: `else: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

## Rule Logic:  

**Rule Assertion:**

- Case 1: `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "PROPOSED BUILDING IS MODELED WITH PURCHASED HOT WATER OR STEAM.  VERIFY THAT HOT WATER RESET IS NOT MODELED IN THE BASELINE MODEL."`
