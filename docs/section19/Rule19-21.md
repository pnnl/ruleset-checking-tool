# Section 19 - Rule 19-21         
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-21       
**Rule Description:** Baseline systems with >= 5,000 CFM supply air and >= 70 %OA shall have energy recovery modeled in the baseline design model (this RDS does not check the modeled value for the enthalpy recovery ratio). The following exceptions apply:
1. Systems serving spaces that are not cooled and that are heated to less than 60°F. 
2. Systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design. 
3. Commercial kitchen hoods (grease) classified as Type 1 by NFPA 96. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design. 
4. Heating systems in Climate Zones 0 through 3. 
5. Cooling systems in Climate Zones 3C, 4C, 5B, 5C, 6B, 7, and 8. 
6. Where the largest exhaust source is less than 75% of the design outdoor airflow. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design. 
7. Systems requiring dehumidification that employ energy recovery in series with the cooling coil. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery and series-style energy recovery coils are not used in the proposed design. 

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/UNDETERMINED     
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.10 and exceptions 1-7        
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** None   

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys()   
2. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()   
3. get_hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source()
4. get_baseline_system_types()

## Rule Logic:      
- Create ditionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMI)`  
- Get climate zone: `climate_zone = ASHRAE229.weather.climate_zone` 
- Check if climate zone is (0-3) 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C, if so set ER_not_req_for_heating_sys equal to true: `if climate_zone in ["CZ0A", "CZ0B", "CZ1A", "CZ1B", "CZ2A", "CZ2B", "CZ3A", "CZ3B", "CZ3C"]: ER_not_req_for_heating_sys = True`             
- Create dictionary of hvac systems, zones, and terminal units: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(B_RMI)`  
This section checks whether energy recovery was modeled at all (not Null or None) and gathers the information to assess whether it was supposed to be modeled (without exceptions considered)
- For each hvac systen in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI:`  
    - Reset ER_modeled boolean variable to false: `ER_modeld = False`  
    - Create a fan system object: `fan_system_b = hvac.fan_system`  
    - Get list of supply fan fan objects: `fan_sys_supply_list = list(fan_system_p.supply_fans)`  
    - Cycle through the list of supply fans: `for fan_b in fan_sys_supply_list:`  
        - Get the supply cfm and add to cumulative supply cfm as the logic cycles through the supply fans: `supply_cfm_b = supply_cfm_b + fan_b.design_airflow`  
    - Get the minimum OA cfm: `OA_cfm = fan_system_b.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
    - Calculate the OA fraction: `OA_fraction = OA_cfm/supply_cfm_b`  
    - Check if there are any energy recovery objects associated with the fan system object and that the type is not equal to None: `if fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery != Null and fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery.energy_recovery_type != "NONE":` 
        - Set energy recovery modeled boolean variable to true: `ER_modeled = True`  
    
    This section checks if any exceptions may be applicable
    - Reset exception 1 applies boolean variable: `exception_1_applies = FALSE`  
    - Reset exception 2 likely applies boolean variable: `exception_2_applies = FALSE`
    - Reset exception 6 likely applies boolean variable: `exception_6_applies = FALSE`    
    - Reset exception 7 likely applies boolean variable: `exception_7_applies = FALSE`    
    - Reset exception 5 likely applies boolean variable: `exception_5_applies = FALSE`    
    - Reset hvac system serves zone with kitchen boolean variable: `serves_kitchen_space = FALSE`  
    - Reset system type is heating only (for assessing exception 4): `sys_type_heating_only = False`  
    - Reset serves zones that are heated to 60F or greater in the proposed boolean (for assessing exception 1): `serves_zones_heated_to_60_or_higher_in_proposed = FALSE` 
    - Reset energy recovery modeled in the proposed boolean variable (many exceptions are contingent on energy recovery not being modeled in the proposed): `ER_modeled_in_proposed = FALSE`  
    - Reset serves zones likely to have systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust boolean variable (for assessing exception 2): `serves_zones_with_systems_likely_exhausting_toxic_etc = FALSE` 
    - Reset serves zones with hvac systems with series heat recovery for dehumidification (for assessing exception 7): `serves_zones_that_have_dehumid_heat_recovery = FALSE` 
    - Reset all_lighting_space_types_defined boolean variable to true: `all_lighting_space_types_defined = true`  
    - Reset all_ventilation_space_types_defined boolean variable to true: `all_ventilation_space_types_defined = true`  

    - Get the list of zones associated with the hvac system: `zone_list = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`     
    - for each zone in zone_list: `for zone in zone_list`  
        - Get the matching zone in the P_RMI (Weili: can we do this with an object instead of ID like I did here?): `zone_p = match_data_element(P_RMI,Zone,zone)`  
        - For each space in zone: `for space_p in zone_p.spaces:`
            - Check if the lighting space type is defined: `if space.lighting_space_type != Null:` 
                - Check if space is of type that is likely to have systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust, if yes then set zone is likely to have systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust boolean variable to true based on lighting_space_type: `if space_p.lighting_space_type in ["LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM"]: serves_zones_with_systems_likely_exhausting_toxic_etc = TRUE`
                - Check if space is of a kitchen space, if yes then set serves_kitchen_space boolean variable to true based on lighting_space_type: `if space_p.lighting_space_type in ["FOOD_PREPARATION_AREA"]: serves_kitchen_space = TRUE`              
            - Else (i.e., space.lighting_space_type = Null), set all_lighting_space_types_defined = true: `all_lighting_space_types_defined = false`
            - Check if the ventilation space type is defined: `if space.ventilation_space_type != Null:` 
                - Check if space is of type that is likely to have systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust, if yes then set zone is likely to have systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust boolean variable to true based on ventilation_space_type: `if space_p.ventilation_space_type in ["MISCELLANEOUS_SPACES_MANUFACTURING_WHERE_HAZARDOUS_MATERIALS_ARE_USED_EXCLUDES_HEAVY_INDUSTRIAL_AND_CHEMICAL_PROCESSES"]:serves_zones_with_systems_likely_exhausting_toxic_etc = TRUE`          
                - Check if space is of type kitchen, if yes then set serves_kitchen_space boolean variable to true based on ventilation_space_type: `if space_p.ventilation_space_type in ["FOOD_AND_BEVERAGE_SERVICE_KITCHEN_COOKING"]:serves_kitchen_space = TRUE`                
            - Else (i.e., space.ventiltion_space_type = Null), set all_ventilation_space_types_defined = true: `all_ventilation_space_types_defined = false`
        - Check if there is a heating setpoint 60F or higher in the temperature schedule: `if max(zone_p,thermostat_heating_setpoint_schedule) >= 60:serves_zones_heated_to_60_or_higher_in_proposed = TRUE`  
        - Get list of HVAC systems associated with the zone in the proposed (P_RMI): `hvac_sys_list = get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(P_RMI, zone_p.id)`  
        - Cycle through each HVAC system to see if it has a cooling coil, energy recovery, and/or heat recovery for dehumidification, if so then set appropriate boolean variable to true: `for hvac_p in hvac_sys_list:`  
            - Check if energy recovery is modeled in the proposed: `hvac_p.fan_system.air_energy_recovery != Null and hvac_p.fan_system.air_energy_recovery.energy_recovery_type != "NONE": ER_modeled_in_proposed = TRUE `  
            - Check the dehumidification type if the hvac system has a cooling coil (for exception 7): `if hvac_p.cooling_system != Null AND hvac_p.cooling_system.dehumidification_type == "SERIES_HEAT_RECOVERY": serves_zones_that_have_dehumid_heat_recovery = TRUE`  
    
    - Check if system type is of a type that is heating only (this is for assessing exeption 4):  `If any(hvac.id in baseline_hvac_system_dict[sys_type] for sys_type in ["SYS-9", "SYS-9b", "SYS-10"]: sys_type_heating_only = TRUE `       
    - Determine if exception 1 applies: `if sys_type_heating_only == TRUE AND serves_zones_heated_to_60_or_higher_in_proposed == FALSE: exception_1_applies = TRUE`  
    - Determine if exception 2 applies: `if ER_modeled_in_proposed == FALSE AND serves_zones_with_systems_likely_exhausting_toxic_etc == TRUE: exception_2_applies = TRUE`  
    - Get list of hvac exhaust, max zone exhaust, and number of hvac fan system exhaust fans: `hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source = list(get_hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source (B_RMI, hvac)`  
    - Determine if exception 6 applies, maximum value of the hvac_fan_sys_exhaust_sum and maximum_zone_exhaust is less than the 75% of the fan system's maximum outdoor airflow: `if ER_modeled_in_proposed == FALSE AND max(hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source["hvac_fan_sys_exhaust_sum"],hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source["maximum_zone_exhaust"]) < 75% * hvac.fan_system.maximum_outdoor_airflow): exception_6_applies = TRUE`  
    - Determine if exception 7 applies: `if ER_modeled_in_proposed == FALSE AND serves_zones_that_have_dehumid_heat_recovery == TRUE: exception_7_applies = TRUE`

    - Case 3: Elif no energy recovery is modeled in the baseline and system serves zone likely to be exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design (exception 2): Pass   :`elif OA_fraction >= 70% and supply_cfm_b >= 5000 and ER_modeled == False and exception_2_applies == TRUE: PASS`  
    - Case 4: Elif no energy recovery is modeled in the baseline and the project is in CZ 0 through 3 and the baseline system is heating only (exception 4): Pass   :`elif OA_fraction >= 70% and supply_cfm_b >= 5000 and ER_modeled == False and ER_not_req_for_heating_sys == TRUE and sys_type_heating_only == TRUE: PASS`  
    - Case 5: Elif no energy recovery is modeled in the baseline and where the largest exhaust source is less than 75% of the design outdoor airflow. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design (exception 6): Pass   :`elif OA_fraction >= 70% and supply_cfm_b >= 5000 and ER_modeled == False and exception_6_applies == TRUE: PASS`  
    - Case 6: Elif no energy recovery is modeled in the baseline and the system has dehumidification that employs energy recovery in series with the cooling coil. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery and series-style energy recovery coils are not used in the proposed design (exception 7): Pass   :`elif OA_fraction >= 70% and supply_cfm_b >= 5000 and ER_modeled == False and exception_7_applies == TRUE: PASS`  
    - Case 7: Elif no energy recovery is modeled in the baseline and the system serves a kitchen type space indicating that exception 3 may be applicable: Pass   :`elif OA_fraction >= 70% and supply_cfm_b >= 5000 and ER_modeled == False and ER_modeled_in_proposed == False and serves_kitchen_space == TRUE: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "The baseline system <hvac.id> supply air cfm >= 5,000 CFM and the OA fraction is >= 70 %OA, per G3.1.2.10 exhaust air energy recovery is required to be modeled in the baseline and it has not been modeled. However, the system serves kitchen type spaces and exception 3 may be applicable which is that commercial kitchen hoods (grease) classified as Type 1 by NFPA 96 shall not require exhaust air energy recovery to be modeled if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design (note that it has not modeled in the proposed). Conduct manual check to determine if exception 3 is applicable."   `  
    - Case 8: Elif no energy recovery is modeled in the baseline and where the largest exhaust source could be less than 75% of the design outdoor airflow and there is more than one exhaust fan associated with the hvac system and it appears that exception 6 could possibly apply then: UNDETERMINED,  note that the third element [2] of the list if the quantity exhaust fans across the hvac system and fourth [3] is the maximum hvac exhaust fan cfm across the multiple hvac system exhaust fans:`elif OA_fraction >= 70% and supply_cfm_b >= 5000 and ER_modeled == False and hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source[2] > 1 and (max(hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source[3],hvac_sys_and_assoc_zones_largest_exhaust_source[1]) < 75% * hvac.fan_system.maximum_outdoor_airflow): UNDETERMINED and raise_message "Exhaust air energy recovery was not modeled in the baseline when the OA fraction is greater or equal to 70% and the supply cfm is greater or equal to 5,000 cfm.

This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design.". There are multilple exhaust fans associated with the hvac system and therefore this could not be assessed as the configuration is unknown. Conduct manual check to determine if this exception applies. If not, then fail. `

    - Case 11: Elif not all space types were defined and energy recovery is not modeled in the proposed so exceptions 2 and 3 could be applicable, fail: `Elif (all_lighting_space_types_defined = false or all_ventilation_space_types_defined = false) and ER_modeled_in_proposed == False: outcome = "Fail" and raise_message "Not all lighting or ventilation space types were defined in the RMD and therefore the potential applicability of exceptions 2 and 3 could not be fully assessed. Fail unless exceptions 2 and 3 are applicable. Exception 2 is that systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust shall not require exhaust air energy recovery to be modeled in the baseline if it is not included in the proposed design. Exception 3 is that commercial kitchen hoods (grease) classified as Type 1 by NFPA 96 shall not require exhaust air energy recovery to be modeled in the baseline if it is not included in the proposed design."  `  
    - Case 12: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = Fail`     

**Notes/Questions:**  
1. Checking the modeled ethalpy recovery ratio (or effectiveness) is covered by anther non primary RDS per decision on group call March 2023.
2. Updated the Rule ID from 19-24 to 19-21 on 04/17/2023
