# Section 19 - Rule 19-26              
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-26               
**Rule Description:**  For cooling sizing runs, schedules for internal loads, including those used for infiltration, occupants, lighting, gas and electricity using equipment, shall be equal to the highest hourly value used in the annual simulation runs and applied to the entire design day. For heating sizing runs, schedules for internal loads, including those used for occupants, lighting, gas and electricity using equipment, shall be equal to the lowest hourly value used in the annual simulation runs, and schedules for infiltration shall be equal to the highest hourly value used in the annual simulation runs and applied to the entire design day.

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE     
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.2.1 excluding exception         
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each Space  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Does not apply to residential dwelling units for the cooling sizing runs. 
  
   
**Function Calls:**  
 
5. match_data_element()  
6. get_component_by_id()  I think this is supposed to return the object associated with an ID?


## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if the space is a residential dwelling unit**  
- For each space in the B_RMI: `for space in B_RMI...Space:`  
    - Reset is_dwelling_unit boolean variable: `is_dwelling_unit = false`  
    - Check if the lighting space type is of a residential dwelling unit type, if not then set is_dwelling_unit = false: `if space.lighting_space_type in ["DWELLING_UNIT"] or space._ventilation_space_type in ["TRANSIENT_RESIDENTIAL_DWELLING_UNIT"]: is_dwelling_unit = true`  
    - Get the zone that the space is part of start by looping through zones: `for zone in B_RMI.Zone:`  
        - Check if the space is associated with the zone: `if space in zone.spaces: applicable_zone = zone`  
    
    Gather information for infiltration checks:
    - Get the infiltration object associated with the zone: `infiltration_obj = applicable_zone.infiltration`  
    - Get the multiplier schedule: `inf_multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,infiltration_obj.multiplier_schedule)`  
    - Get the design_heating_multiplier_schedule: `inf_design_heating_multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,infiltration_obj.design_heating_multiplier_schedule)`  
    - Get the design_cooling_multiplier_schedule: `inf_design_cooling_multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,infiltration_obj.design_cooling_multiplier_schedule)`  
    - Get the highest hourly value used in the infiltration multiplier schedule (not sure if the schedule needs to be transformed or anything, for example, what if it is an event schedule?): `max_infiltration_value = max(inf_multiplier_sch.hourly_values)`  

    Gather information for occupant checks:
    - Get the multiplier schedule: `occ_multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,space.occupant_multiplier_schedule)`  
    - Get the design_heating_multiplier_schedule: `occ_design_heating_multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,space.occupant_design_heating_multiplier_schedule)`  
    - Get the design_cooling_multiplier_schedule: `Occ_design_cooling_multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,space.occupant_design_cooling_multiplier_schedule)`  
    - Get the highest hourly value used in the multiplier schedule (not sure if the schedule needs to be transformed or anything, for example, what if it is an event schedule?): `occ_max_value = max(occ_multiplier_sch.hourly_values)`   
    - Get the lowest hourly value used in the multiplier schedule (not sure if the schedule needs to be transformed or anything, for example, what if it is an event schedule?): `occ_min_value = min(occ_multiplier_sch.hourly_values)`   

STOPPED because not sure how to the min and max multiplier when there are multiple lighting, misc objects. 

            - **Rule Assertion:** 
            - Case 1: If then pass: `if (: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 2: Else if : outome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message ""`  
            - Case 3: Else if : `: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 3: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`


**Notes/Questions:**  
1. 90.1 definition of dwelling unit " a single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation." Not sure any other space types other than dwelling unit meet this definition. 
2. Thought about including an applicability check at the start to see if there are any dwelling units in the building but it would involve looping through each space which is the same thing that the existing app check is doing so I left it out.
3. Jason is to add design heating and cooling multiplier schedules to the schema for
