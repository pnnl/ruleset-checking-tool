# Section 19 - Rule 19-11         
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-11         
**Rule Description:** For systems that serve computer rooms, if the  baseline system is HVAC System 11, it shall include an integrated fluid economizer meeting the requirements of Section 6.5.1.2 in the baseline building design.  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE      
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.6.1        
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Baseline HVAC systems that serve computer rooms and are of system type 11.    
 

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_baseline_system_types  
2. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms  


## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
- Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMI)`  
- Check if B-RMI is modeled with at least one air-side system that is of system type 11, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for all HVAC systems: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.1a", "SYS-11b", "SYS-11c","SYS-11.2","SYS-11.2a"]):`
    This segment carries out the check for all applicable HVAC system types (outcome for inapplicable system types will be NOT_APPLICABLE)
    - Get list of hvac systems in the B_RMI primarily serving computer rooms (maybe need to update if this should be any system with a computer room space, would also have to revise 19-10): `HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms(B_RMI)`  
    - For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:` 
        - Check if system type is of an applicable system type and that it serves computer rooms (Q: primary or if any space is a computer room?), if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system:  `If any(hvac.id in baseline_hvac_system_dict[sys_type] for sys_type in ["SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.1a", "SYS-11b", "SYS-11c","SYS-11.2","SYS-11.2a"]) AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: `     

        TBD depending on answer to loop question.
                
                - **Rule Assertion:** 
                - Case 1: The system primarily serves computer rooms and the baseline system type is 3 or 4 and no economizer is modeled then pass (this is exception #3): `if (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "PASS"`  
                - Case 2: Elif the building has refrigerated cases, the building segment building area type is retail and no economizer is modeled in the baseline or proposed and so the system likely meets exception #2 so outcome is pass (this is exception #2): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac in hvac_system_exception_2_list: outcome = "PASS"`                  
                - Case 3: Elif the system primarily serves computer rooms and the baseline system type is 3 or 4 and an economizer is modeled then fail (this is exception #3): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "TEMPERATURE") AND hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "FAIL" and raise_message "This system [hvac.id] appears to meet the criteria associated with Section G3.1.2.6 exception #3 which is that an economizer shall not be modeled in the baseline for systems that serve computer rooms complying with Section G3.1.2.6.1. "`  
                - Case 4: Elif the building has refrigerated cases, the building segment building area type is retail and an economizer is modeled in the baseline but not the proposed and so the system likely meets exception #2 so outcome is UNDETERMINED (this is exception #2): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "TEMPERATURE") AND hvac in hvac_system_exception_2_list: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "This system [hvac.id] appears to meet the criteria associated with Section G3.1.2.6 exception #2 which is that an economizer shall not be modeled in the baseline for systems where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems and the proposed system does not include an economizer. An economizer has been modeled in the baseline when it appears this exception may apply. Manual check recommended."`                     
                - Case 5: Elif there is an AirEconomizer object associated with the fan and the AirEconomizer type is dry bulb (i.e., Temperature) then pass: `elif hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "TEMPERATURE": outcome = "PASS"`  
                - Case 6: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail and raise_message "Fail unless the system [include hvac.id] includes a gas-phase air cleaning to meet the requirements of Standard 62.1, Section 6.1.2. This, G3.1.2.6 exception #1, shall be used only if the system in the proposed design does not match the building design."`  

**Notes/Questions:**  
1. Serve computers rooms? Primarily or if any space is a computer room?
2. Which loop would the integrated waterside economizer be on? The primary or secondary chilled water loop? The CW loop?
