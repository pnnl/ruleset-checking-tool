# Section 19 - Rule 19-40         
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24      
**Mandatory Rule:** False      
**Rule ID:** 19-40         
**Rule Description:** Baseline systems required to model energy recovery per G3.1.2.10 shall be modeled with a 50% enthalpy recovery ratio. 

**Rule Assertion:** Options are UNDETERMINED/NOT_APPLICABLE     
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.10         
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 
1. hvac systems modeled with energy recovery in the baseline.   

**Function Calls:**  None  

## Rule Logic:      
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each hvac systen in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI:`  
    - Create a fan system object: `fan_system_b = hvac.fan_system`  
    - Check if there are any energy recovery objects associated with the fan system object and that the type is not equal to None, Else then this rule outcome is Not_Applicable: `if fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery != Null and fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery.energy_recovery_type != "NONE":` 
        **Rule Assertion:** 
        - Case 1: Energy recovery was modeled (whether or not is supposed to be modeled or not is checked by another RDS):UNDETERMINED: `outcome = UNDETERMINED and raise_message "<insert hvac.id> was modeled with a design sensible effectiveness of <insert hvac.fan_system.air_energy_recovery.design_sensible_effectiveness> and a design latent effectiveness of <insert hvac.fan_system.air_energy_recovery.design_latent_effectiveness>. Confirm that a 50% enthalpy recovery ratio was modeled.`  

**Notes/Questions:**  
1. What do you think of the message?  
2. We check that ER was modeled when it is supposed to be modeled in 19-24 so I do not think there is a reason to repeat all of the logic here.  I think its fine to just show the reviewer all places where it was modeled.
