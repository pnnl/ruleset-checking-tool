# Section 19 - Rule 19-10       
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-10       
**Rule Description:** Air economizers shall be included in baseline HVAC Systems 3 through 8, and 11, 12, and 13 based on climate as specified in Section G3.1.2.6 including exception #s 2 and 3 and excluding exception #1.    
1. Systems that include gas-phase air cleaning to meet the requirements of Standard 62.1, Section 6.1.2. This exception shall be used only if the system in the  proposed design does not match the building design.
2. Where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems. This exception shall only be used if the system in the  proposed design does not use an economizer. If the exception is used, an economizer shall not be included in the baseline building design.
3. Systems that serve computer rooms complying with Section G3.1.2.6.1.

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED       
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.6 including exceptions 2 and 3.      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Applies to buildings NOT in climate zones 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A.   
2. Applies to baseline HVAC system types 3 through 8, and 11, 12, and 13.   
 

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_baseline_system_types  
2. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms  
3. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area  
4. Get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone  

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 -  Check if Climate Zone Requires Economizer**  
- Get climate zone: `climate_zone = ASHRAE229.weather.climate_zone` 
- If climate zone is not 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A then carry on, otherwise outcome for all HVAC systems NOT_APPLICABLE: `if climate_zone Not in ["CZ0A", "CZ0B", "CZ1A", "CZ1B", "CZ2A", "CZ3A", "CZ4A"]:`  
    **Applicability Check 2 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
    - Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMI)`  
    - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system type 3 through 8, or 11, 12, and 13, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the project: `for sys_type in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4", "SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b","SYS-7", "SYS-7a", "SYS-7b", "SYS-7c","SYS-8", "SYS-8a", "SYS-8b", "SYS-8c","SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.1a", "SYS-11b", "SYS-11c","SYS-11.2","SYS-11.2a","SYS-12", "SYS-12a", "SYS-12b", "SYS-12c","SYS-13", "SYS-13a"]):`
        - Check if values are not none for system type key in the dictionary, if it does not equal false then the values are not none and there are applicable system types in the project: `if bool(baseline_system_types_dict.get(sys_type)) != False: is_there_applicable_sys_type = TRUE`  
    - Check if is_there_applicable_sys_type == True which means there are applicable system types in the project, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the project: `if  is_there_applicable_sys_type == True:`  
        This segment creates a list of baseline hvac system IDs in which G3.1.2.6 exception #2 is likely applicable, the exceptions states "where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems. This exception shall only be used if the system in the proposed design does not use an economizer. If the exception is used, an economizer shall not be included in the baseline building design."
        - For each building in the B_RMI: ``for bldg in B_RMI...Building:`  
            - Check of the building has refrigerated cases: `if bldg.refrigerated_cases != Null:`  
                - For each building segment in the building: `for bldg_seg in bldg.building_segments:`  
                    - Check if the building area type is retail: `if bldg_seg.lighting_building_area_type == "RETAIL":`  
                        - Create dictionary with hvac iD and zone id list: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area(B_RMI)` 
                        - For each hvac system in the building segment: `for hvac_b in bldg_seg.heating_ventilating_air_conditioning_systems:`  
                            - Reset proposed_has_economizer boolean variable to FALSE: `proposed_has_economizer =  FALSE`  
                            - Get zone ids associated with the HVAC system: `zone_list_b = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict[hvac_b.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
                            - Check if any of the zones are served by an economizer in the proposed design model, start by cycling through each zone served by the baseline HVAC system: `for zone_b in zone_list_b:`  
                                - Get analogous zone ID in the P_RMI: `zone_p = match_data_element(P_RMI,Zone,zone_b)`  
                                - Get list of HVAC system IDs associated with the zone in the proposed: `hvac_sys_list_p = Get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(P_RMI, zone_p)`  
                                - Loop through each HVAC system and check if it is equipped with an economizer, if it is then set proposed_has_economizer equal to TRUE : `for hvac_p in hvac_sys_list_p:`  
                                    - Convert hvac_p (which is an ID) to an HVAC object (however the RCT team does this, if this is even needed): `hvac_p_obj = hvac_p`  
                                    - Check if the HVAC system is equipped with an economizer: `if hvac_p_obj.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac_p_obj.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type != "FIXED_FRACTION": proposed_has_economizer = TRUE`  
                            - Check if the proposed_has_economizer boolean variable still equals FALSE, if it does then add hvac_b to list of hvac systems where exception #2 is likely applicable: `if proposed_has_economizer == FALSE: hvac_system_exception_2_list.append(hvac_b)`
        
        This segment carries out the check for all applicable HVAC system types (outcome for inapplicable system types will be NOT_APPLICABLE)
        - Get list of hvac systems in the B_RMI primarily serving computer rooms (this is to evaluate Exception #3): `HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms(B_RMI)`  
        - For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:` 
            - Check if system type is of an applicable system type, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system:  `If any(hvac.id in baseline_hvac_system_dict[sys_type] for sys_type in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4", "SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b","SYS-7", "SYS-7a", "SYS-7b", "SYS-7c","SYS-8", "SYS-8a", "SYS-8b", "SYS-8c","SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.1a", "SYS-11b", "SYS-11c","SYS-11.2","SYS-11.2a","SYS-12", "SYS-12a", "SYS-12b", "SYS-12c","SYS-13", "SYS-13a"]): `            
                - Get hvac system type: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_system_types_dict.keys()[list(baseline_system_types_dict.values()).index(hvac.id)]`       
                - **Rule Assertion:** 
                - Case 1: The system primarily serves computer rooms and the baseline system type is 3 or 4 and no economizer is modeled then pass (this is exception #3): `if (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "PASS"`  
                - Case 2: Elif the building has refrigerated cases, the building segment building area type is retail and no economizer is modeled in the baseline or proposed and so the system likely meets exception #2 so outcome is pass (this is exception #2): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac in hvac_system_exception_2_list: outcome = "PASS"`                  
                - Case 3: Elif the system primarily serves computer rooms and the baseline system type is 3 or 4 and an economizer is modeled then fail (this is exception #3): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "TEMPERATURE") AND hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "FAIL" and raise_message "This system [hvac.id] appears to meet the criteria associated with Section G3.1.2.6 exception #3 which is that an economizer shall not be modeled in the baseline for systems that serve computer rooms complying with Section G3.1.2.6.1. "`  
                - Case 4: Elif the building has refrigerated cases, the building segment building area type is retail and an economizer is modeled in the baseline but not the proposed and so the system likely meets exception #2 so outcome is UNDETERMINED (this is exception #2): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "TEMPERATURE") AND hvac in hvac_system_exception_2_list: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "This system [hvac.id] appears to meet the criteria associated with Section G3.1.2.6 exception #2 which is that an economizer shall not be modeled in the baseline for systems where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems and the proposed system does not include an economizer. An economizer has been modeled in the baseline when it appears this exception may apply. Manual check recommended."`                     
                - Case 5: Elif there is an AirEconomizer object associated with the fan and the AirEconomizer type is dry bulb (i.e., Temperature) then pass: `elif hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "TEMPERATURE": outcome = "PASS"`  
                - Case 6: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail and raise_message "Fail unless the system [include hvac.id] includes a gas-phase air cleaning to meet the requirements of Standard 62.1, Section 6.1.2. This, G3.1.2.6 exception #1, shall be used only if the system in the proposed design does not match the building design."`  

**Notes/Questions:**  
1. The outcome could be NOT_APPLICABLE if the HVAC baseline system was not defined correctly. I guess this is fine because they will have to fix the HVAC system anyway and this check will just have to be run at the next iteration.   
2. With exceptions 2 and 3, shall we let it pass if an economizer is modeled in the baseline since its more conservative?
