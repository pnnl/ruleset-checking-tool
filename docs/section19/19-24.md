# Section 19 - Rule 19-24         
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-24       
**Rule Description:** Baseline systems with >4,999 CFM supply air and >69.99%OA shall have energy recovery with 50% enthalpy recovery ratio. The following exceptions apply:
1. Systems serving spaces that are not cooled and that are heated to less than 60Â°F. 
2. Systems exhausting toxic, flammable, or corrosive fumes or paint or dust. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design. 
3. Commercial kitchen hoods (grease) classified as Type 1 by NFPA 96. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design. 
4. Heating systems in Climate Zones 0 through 3. 
5. Cooling systems in Climate Zones 3C, 4C, 5B, 5C, 6B, 7, and 8. 
6. Where the largest exhaust source is less than 75% of the design outdoor airflow. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery is not used in the proposed design. 
7. Systems requiring dehumidification that employ energy recovery in series with the cooling coil. This exception shall only be used if exhaust air energy recovery and series-style energy recovery coils are not used in the proposed design. 

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED     
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.10 and exceptions 1-7        
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** None  

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys()   
2. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()   
3. Get_largest_exhaust_source_cfm()

## Rule Logic:      
- Get climate zone: `climate_zone = ASHRAE229.weather.climate_zone` 
- Check if climate zone is (0-3) 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 3C, if so set not_req_for_heating_sys equal to true: `if climate_zone in ["CZ0A", "CZ0B", "CZ1A", "CZ1B", "CZ2A", "CZ2B", "CZ3A", "CZ3B", "CZ3C",]: not_req_for_heating_sys = True`             
- For each hvac systen in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI:`  
    - Reset ER_modeld boolean variable to false: `ER_modeld = False`  
    - Create a fan system object: `fan_system_b = hvac.fan_system`  
    - Get list of supply fan fan objects: `fan_sys_supply_list = list(fan_system_p.supply_fans)`  
    - Cycle through the list of supply fans: `for fan_b in fan_sys_supply_list:`  
        - Get the supply cfm and add to cumulative supply cfm as the logic cycles through the supply fans: `supply_cfm_b = supply_cfm_b + fan_b.design_airflow`  
    - Get the minimum OA cfm (use min or max OA cfm?): `OA_cfm = fan_system_b.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
    - Calculate the OA fraction: `OA_fraction = OA_cfm/supply_cfm_b`  
    - Check if there are any energy recovery objects associated with the fan system object and that the type is not equal to None: `if fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery != Null and fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery.energy_recovery_type != "NONE":` 
        - Set energy recovery modeled boolean variable to true: `ER_modeled = True`  
        - Get the enthalpy recovery ratio: `enthalpy_rec_ratio = fan_sys_b.air_energy_recovery.enthalpy_recovery_ratio`  

            
            - **Rule Assertion:** 
            - Case 1: If fan_power_W_CFM equals 0.3: `if fan_power_W_CFM == 0.3: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 2: Elif conservative comparison less equal:`elif AHJ_RA_compare == True and fan_power_W_CFM <= 0.3: PASS`
            - Case 3: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`
