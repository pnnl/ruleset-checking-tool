## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
- Create a list of the target system types: `target_system_types = [HVAC_SYS.SYS_9, HVAC_SYS.SYS_10]`  
- Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMI)`  
- Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is of type 9 or 10, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the project: `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(system_type, target_sys_type, false) for system_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for target_system_type in target_system_types):` 
    - Create dictionary of hvac systems and associated zones and terminal units: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_x = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(B_RMI)`  
    - For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:` 
        - Reset all_design_setpoints_105 boolean to true: `all_design_setpoints_105 = true`  
        - Get the baseline system type: `sys_type = list(baseline_system_types_dict.keys())[list(baseline_system_types_dict.values()).index(hvac.id)])`
        - Check if system type is of an applicable system type, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system:  `If baseline_system_type_compare(sys_type, HVAC_SYS.SYS_9, false) == TRUE OR baseline_system_type_compare(sys_type, HVAC_SYS.SYS_10, false) == TRUE: `    
            - Get list of zones served by the hvac system: `zone_list_hvac_sys_x = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_x[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]` 
            - Get list of terminal units served by the hvac system: `terminal_list_hvac_sys_x = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_x[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]["Terminal_Unit_List"]`  
            - For each terminal unit associated with the hvac system (should only be one): `for terminal in terminal_list_hvac_sys_x:`  
                - Get the design supply temperature setpoint: `design_supply_air_temp_setpoint = terminal.supply_design_heating_setpoint_temperature`  
                - Check if the design supply air temperature setpoint does not equal 105F, if it doesn't then set all_design_setpoints_105 to false: `if design_supply_air_temp_setpoint != 105: all_design_setpoints_105 = false`  
            Below sums the terminal unit primary air flow associated with each zone that this baseline hvac system serves in the baseline in the proposed in order to compare baseline and proposed supply cfm in the Case 3 below:
            - For each zone served by the HVAC system: `for zone in zone_list_hvac_sys_x:`  
                - Get P_RMI zone object (however the RCT accomplishes this): `zone_p = match_data_element(P_RMI, Zone, zone.id)`  
                    - For each terminal unit associated with the zone: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`  
                        - Add the terminal air flow to the proposed_supply_cfm: `proposed_supply_cfm = proposed_supply_cfm + terminal_p.primary_airflow`              
            
            - **Rule Assertion:** 
            - Case 1: If the design supply air temperatures setpoint equals 105F, the fan is autosized and the FanSystem.minimum_airflow>=FanSystem.Minimum_Outdoor_Airflow and there is only one supply fan: `if list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI,fan_sys_b)["Fan_Power"]["Fan_CFM"]["Fan_Qty"])[0] ==1 and all_design_setpoints_105 == true and list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI, hvac.fan_system)["Fan_CFM"])[0] >= hvac.fan_system.minimum_outdoor_airflow and are_all_hvac_sys_fan_objs_autosized(B_RMI, hvac) == True : outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 2: Else if design supply air temperatures setpoint does not equal 105F, and the fan system supply cfm equals the fan system minumum OA cfm (i.e., airflow rate is minimum outdoor airflow rate) and there is only one supply fan then pass: `elif list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI,fan_sys_b)["Fan_Power"]["Fan_CFM"]["Fan_Qty"])[0] ==1 and all_design_setpoints_105 == false and list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI, hvac.fan_system)["Fan_CFM"])[0] = hvac.fan_system.minimum_outdoor_airflow: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 3: Else if design supply air temperatures setpoint does not equal 105F, and the baseline fan system supply cfm equals the proposed (i.e., airflow rate could be dictated by applicable codes or accreditation standard) and there is only one supply fan then UNDETERMINED: `elif list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI,fan_sys_b)["Fan_Power"]["Fan_CFM"]["Fan_Qty"])[0] ==1 and all_design_setpoints_105 == false and list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI, hvac.fan_system)["Fan_CFM"])[0] == proposed_supply_cfm: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "<insert hvac.id> was not modeled with a supply air temperature set point of 105°F. The baseline and proposed supply cfm was modeled identically at <insert proposed_supply_cfm> CFM. Manual review is required to determine if the airflow rate was modeled to comply with applicable codes or accreditation standards. If not, fail."`   
            - Case 4: Else if there is more than one supply fan then outcome is UNDETERMINED: `elif list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_kW_CFM(B_RMI,fan_sys_b)["Fan_Power"]["Fan_CFM"]["Fan_Qty"])[0] != 1: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "<insert hvac.id> has more than one supply fan associated with the HVAC system in the baseline and therefore this check could not be conducted for this HVAC sytem. Conduct manual check for compliance with G3.1.2.8.2."`   
            - Case 5: Else, Fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`
