# Section 19 - Rule 19-10       
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24    
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-10       
**Rule Description:** Air economizers shall be included in baseline HVAC Systems 3 through 8, and 11, 12, and 13 based on climate as specified in Section G3.1.2.6 with the following exceptions:   
1. Systems that include gas-phase air cleaning to meet the requirements of Standard 62.1, Section 6.1.2. This exception shall be used only if the system in the  proposed design does not match the building design.
2. Where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems. This exception shall only be used if the system in the  proposed design does not use an economizer. If the exception is used, an economizer shall not be included in the baseline building design.
3. Systems that serve computer rooms complying with Section G3.1.2.6.1.

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED       
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.6 including exceptions 1-3.      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Applies to buildings NOT in climate zones 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A.   
2. Applies to baseline HVAC system types 3 through 8, and 11, 12, and 13.   
 

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_baseline_system_types   
2. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms()    
3. baseline_system_type_compare()  
4. is_economizer_modeled_in_proposed()  

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 -  Check if Climate Zone Requires Economizer**  
- Get climate zone: `climate_zone = ASHRAE229.weather.climate_zone` 
- If climate zone is not 0A, 0B, 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A then carry on, otherwise outcome for all HVAC systems NOT_APPLICABLE: `if climate_zone Not in ["CZ0A", "CZ0B", "CZ1A", "CZ1B", "CZ2A", "CZ3A", "CZ4A"]:`  
    **Applicability Check 2 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
    - Create a list of the target system types: `target_system_types = [HVAC_SYS.SYS_3, HVAC_SYS.SYS_4, HVAC_SYS.SYS_5,HVAC_SYS.SYS_6,HVAC_SYS.SYS_7,HVAC_SYS.SYS_8,HVAC_SYS.SYS_11_1,HVAC_SYS.SYS_12,HVAC_SYS.SYS_13]`
    - Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMD)`  
    - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is of type 3 through 8, and 11, 12, and 13, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the project: `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(system_type, target_sys_type, false) for system_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for target_system_type in target_system_types):` 
        This segment creates a list of baseline hvac system IDs in which G3.1.2.6 exception #2 is likely applicable, the exceptions states "where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems. This exception shall only be used if the system in the proposed design does not use an economizer. If the exception is used, an economizer shall not be included in the baseline building design."
        - For each building in the B_RMD: `for bldg in B_RMI...Building:`  
            - Check of the building has refrigerated cases: `if bldg.refrigerated_cases != Null:`  
                - For each building segment in the building: `for bldg_seg in bldg.building_segments:`  
                    - Check if the building area type is retail: `if bldg_seg.lighting_building_area_type == "RETAIL":`  
                        - For each hvac system in the building segment: `for hvac_b in bldg_seg.heating_ventilating_air_conditioning_systems:`  
                            - Check if an economizer was modeled in the proposed (for any zone that the baseline hvac system serves): `proposed_has_economizer = is_economizer_modeled_in_proposed(B_RMI,P_RMI,hvac_b)`  
                            - Check if the proposed_has_economizer boolean variable still equals FALSE, if it does then add hvac_b to list of hvac systems where exception #2 is likely applicable: `if proposed_has_economizer == FALSE: hvac_system_exception_2_list.append(hvac_b)`
        
        This segment carries out the check for all applicable HVAC system types (outcome for inapplicable system types will be NOT_APPLICABLE)
        - Get list of hvac systems in the B_RMI primarily serving computer rooms (this is to evaluate Exception #3): `HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms(B_RMI)`  
        - For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:` 
            - Get the baseline system type: `hvac_sys_type_b = list(baseline_system_types_dict.keys())[list(baseline_system_types_dict.values()).index(hvac.id)])`
            - Check if system type is of an applicable system type, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system:  `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(hvac_sys_type_b, target_sys_type, false) for target_system_type in target_system_types):`                                       
                - Check if an economizer was modeled in the proposed (for any zone that the baseline hvac system serves): `proposed_has_economizer = is_economizer_modeled_in_proposed(B_RMI,P_RMI,hvac_b)`  
                
                - **Rule Assertion:** 
                - Case 1: The system primarily serves computer rooms and the baseline system type is 3 or 4 and no economizer is modeled then pass (this is exception #3): `if (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "PASS"`  
                - Case 2: Elif the building has refrigerated cases, the building segment building area type is retail and no economizer is modeled in the baseline or proposed and so the system may meet exception #2 outcome is UNDETERMINED (this is exception #2): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac in hvac_system_exception_2_list: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "Undetermined unless any of the zones served by the baseline system <insert hvac.id> in the proposed design include supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems that will be affected by using outdoor air for cooling (G3.1.2.6 exception #2).:"`                  
                - Case 3: Elif the system primarily serves computer rooms and the baseline system type is 3 or 4 and an economizer is modeled then fail (this is exception #3): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type != "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "FAIL" and raise_message "This system [hvac.id] appears to meet the criteria associated with Section G3.1.2.6 exception #3 which is that an economizer shall not be modeled in the baseline for systems that serve computer rooms complying with Section G3.1.2.6.1. "`  
                - Case 4: Elif the building has refrigerated cases, the building segment building area type is retail and an economizer is modeled in the baseline but not the proposed and so the system likely meets exception #2 so outcome is UNDETERMINED (this is exception #2): `elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type != "FIXED_FRACTION") AND hvac in hvac_system_exception_2_list: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "This system [hvac.id] appears to meet the criteria associated with Section G3.1.2.6 exception #2 which is that an economizer shall not be modeled in the baseline for systems where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems and the proposed system does not include an economizer. An economizer has been modeled in the baseline when it appears this exception may apply. Manual check recommended."`                     
                - Case 5: Elif there is an AirEconomizer object associated with the fan and the AirEconomizer type is not fixed fraction (which indicates there is an economizer) then pass: `elif hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer != Null AND hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type != "FIXED_FRACTION" AND hvac_sys_type_b not in ["SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4"] AND hvac.id not in HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list: outcome = "PASS"`  
                - Case 6: Elif, no economizer is modeled in the baseline or proposed then fail: `Elif (hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer == Null OR hvac.fan_system.AirEconomizer.type == "FIXED_FRACTION") and proposed_has_economizer == false : outcome = "Fail" and raise_message "Fail unless any of the zones served by the baseline system [include hvac.id] are served in the proposed design by systems with a gas-phase air cleaning where such air cleaning is requirements of Standard 62.1, Section 6.1.2 (G3.1.2.6 exception #1) or where the use of outdoor air for cooling will affect supermarket open refrigerated case-work systems (G3.1.2.6 exception #2)."`  
                - Case 7: Else, then fail (no economizer is modeled in the baseline when expected and an economizer is modeled in the proposed so Exceptions 1 and 2 cannot apply): `Else: outcome = "Fail"`  

**Notes/Questions:**    
1. Decided against allowing projects to pass when an economizer is modeled when not required even when AHJ_RA_compare == True. 
2. Since we cannot assess Exception 1 at all, should this be considered as included. I think so because we do not have a separate RDS for it as there does not appear to be any benefit to that.
