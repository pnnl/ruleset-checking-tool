**Mandatory Rule:** False    
**Rule ID:** 19-2     
**Rule Description:** Weather conditions used in sizing runs to determine baseline equipment capacities shall be based either on hourly historical weather files containing typical peak conditions or on design days developed using 99.6% heating design temperatures and 1% dry-bulb and 1% wet-bulb cooling design temperatures.    
**Rule Assertion:** Options are UNDETERMINED     
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.2.1

**Applicability Checks:** None  

**Function Calls:**  None

## Rule Logic:   
- For each RulesetModelInstance in the ASHRAE229.ruleset_model_instances: `for ruleset_model_instances in ASHRAE229.ruleset_model_instances:` 
    - **Rule Assertion:** 
    - All cases: Conduct manual check that rule is met:  `outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "Check that the weather conditions used in sizing runs to determine baseline equipment capacities is based either on hourly historical weather files containing typical peak conditions or on design days developed using 99.6% heating design temperatures and 1% dry-bulb and 1% wet-bulb cooling design temperatures."      `
