# Section 19 - Rule 19-16           
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** False    
**Rule ID:** 19-16           
**Rule Description:** For zones served by baseline system types 9 & 10, if the proposed design includes a fan or fans sized and controlled to provide non-mechanical cooling, the baseline building design shall include a separate fan to provide nonmechanical cooling, sized and controlled the same as the proposed design.      

**Rule Assertion:** Options NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED      
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.8.2          
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each Zone    

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Zones that include non-mechanical cooling and are served by baseline system types 9 or 10.   
 

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_baseline_system_types   
2. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone  
3. baseline_system_type_compare     
4. match_data_element  


## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
- Create a list of the target system types: `target_system_types = [HVAC_SYS.SYS_9, HVAC_SYS.SYS_10]`  
- Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMD)`  
- Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is of type 9 or 10, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the project: `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(system_type, target_sys_type, false) for system_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for target_system_type in target_system_types):` 
    This segment identifies applicable zones (outcome for inapplicable zones will be NOT_APPLICABLE)
    - For each Zone in the B_RMD: `for zone in B_RMD...Zone:` 
        - Reset the zone_served_by_sys_9_or_10 boolean variable to FALSE: `zone_served_by_sys_9_or_10 = FALSE`  
        - Reset hvac_has_non_mech_cooling boolean variable to false: `hvac_has_non_mech_cooling = False`  
        - Get the analogous zone object in the P_RMI: `zone_p = match_data_element(P_RMR,Zone,zone.id)` 
        - Get list of hvac systems serving this zone in the proposed design model: `hvac_sys_list_p = get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(P_RMI, zone_p)`  
        - Check if any of the hvac systems serving the zone have non-mechanical cooling as the cooling_system type: `for hvac_p in hvac_sys_list_P:`  
            - Check if the system has non-mechanical cooling: `if hvac_p.cooling_system.type == "NON_MECHANICAL": hvac_has_non_mech_cooling = True`  
        - Check if the zone has non-mechanical cooling in the proposed design defined at the zone level or if hvac_has_non_mech_cooling equals true, if false for both then the zone is NOT_APPLICABLE, otherwise carry on: `If (zone_p.non_mechanical_cooling_fan_airflow != Null AND zone_p.non_mechanical_cooling_fan_airflow != 0) or hvac_has_non_mech_cooling == True:`  
            - Get list of the HVAC systems associated with the zone in the baseline: `hvac_sys_list_b = get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(B_RMD, zone)`  
            - Check if any are of system 9 or 10: `for hvac in hvac_sys_list_b:`  
                - Get the baseline system type: `sys_type = list(baseline_system_types_dict.keys())[list(baseline_system_types_dict.values()).index(hvac.id)])`
                - Check if system type is of an applicable system type:  `If (baseline_system_type_compare(sys_type, HVAC_SYS.SYS_9, false) == TRUE OR baseline_system_type_compare(sys_type, HVAC_SYS.SYS_10, false) == TRUE): zone_served_by_sys_9_or_10 = TRUE`    
                
            - **Rule Assertion:** 
            - Case 1: The zone has non-mechanical cooling in the proposed design and the zone is served by either system 9 or 10 in the baseline then outcome is UNDETERMINED: `if zone_served_by_sys_9_or_10 == True: outcome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "<Insert zone.id> has non-mechanical cooling in the proposed design and the zone is served by either system 9 or 10 in the baseline, conduct a manual check that the baseline building design includes a separate fan to provide nonmechanical cooling, sized and controlled the same as the proposed design."`
