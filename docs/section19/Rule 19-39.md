## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**  Checks each HVAC system for applicability  (does it serve only labs) otherwise outcome is NOT_APPLICABLE
- Create dictionary of hvac systems and associated zones and terminal units for the baseline: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(B_RMI)`   
- For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`  
    - Reset modeled_100_percent_OA boolean variable to false: `modeled_100_percent_OA = false`  
    - Reset the possibly_modeled_100_percent_OA to false: `possibly_modeled_100_percent_OA = false`    
    - Reset the likely_NOT_modeled_100_percent_OA to false: `likely_NOT_modeled_100_percent_OA = false`  
    - Reset hvac_system_serves_only_labs boolean variable to true: `hvac_system_serves_only_labs = true`  
    - Reset all_lighting_space_types_defined boolean variable to true: `all_lighting_space_types_defined = true`  
    - Reset are_any_lighting_space_types_defined boolean variable to true: `are_any_lighting_space_types_defined = false`  
    
    - Get list of zones served by the hvac system: `zones_list_hvac_sys_b = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
    
    - For each zone associated with the HVAC system: `for zone in zones_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
        - For each space associated with the zone, check if any spaces are NOT labs or if any lighting space types are not defined: `for space in zone.spaces:`
            - Check if hvac_system_serves_only_labs = true (no need to keep looping through space types if it equals false): `if hvac_system_serves_only_labs == true:`  
                - Check if the lighting space type is defined: `if space.lighting_space_type != Null:`    
                    - Set are_any_lighting_space_types_defined = true: `are_any_lighting_space_types_defined = true`  
                    - Check if the lighting space type is NOT a lab: `if space.lighting_space_type not in [LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM]: hvac_system_serves_only_labs = false`    
                - Else (i.e., space.lighting_space_type = Null), set all_lighting_space_types_defined = true: `all_lighting_space_types_defined = false`                 
    - Check if hvac_system_serves_only_labs equal true, if yes then carry on, if not then outcome is NOT_APPLICABLE: `if hvac_system_serves_only_labs == true:`  
        - Set counter equal to 0: `counter = 0`  
        - For each zone associated with the HVAC system: `for zone in zones_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
            - Add each zone's OA CFM schedule to the list of zone OA CFM schedules for the baseline: `zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_b[counter] = get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone(B_RMI, zone.id)`  
            - Get the analogous zone object from the proposed RMI (if this is not strictly the correct syntax please advise Weili): `zone_p = get_component_by_id(P_RMI,match_data_element(P_RMI,Zone,zone.id))`    
            - Add each zone's OA CFM schedule to the list of zone OA CFM schedules for the proposed: `zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_p[counter] = get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone(P_RMI, zone_p.id)`  
            - Add to counter: `counter = counter + 1`

        - Create aggregated OA CFM schedule for the baseline for the zones served by the hvac system: `aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_b = aggregate_min_OA_schedule_across_zones(B_RMI,zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_b)`  
        - Create aggregated OA CFM schedule for the proposed for the zones served by the baseline hvac system: `aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_p = aggregate_min_OA_schedule_across_zones(P_RMI,zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_p)`  
        - Reset OA_CFM_schedules_match boolean variable to True: `OA_CFM_schedules_match = True`  
        - Check if schedules mismatch for any hours of the year, if so set boolean to false: `for p to Range(8760):`  
            - Check if the baseline and proposed schedules mismatch: `if aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_b[p] != aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_p[p]: OA_CFM_schedule_match = false`   
        - Sum OA CFM across baseline schedule to get the total for comparison purposes in the rule assertions: `modeled_baseline_total_zone_min_OA_CFM = sum(aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_b)`  
        - Sum OA CFM across proposed schedule to get the total for comparison purposes in the rule assertions: `modeled_proposed_total_zone_min_OA_CFM = sum(aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_p)`  

        - Get the maximum_outdoor_airflow for the fan system: `max_OA_flow = hvac.fan_system.maximum_outdoor_airflow`  
        - Get the design supply air flow: `design_supply_flow = list(get_fan_system_object_supply_return_exhaust_relief_total_power_flow(B_RMI, hvac.fan_system)["supply_fans_airflow])`  
        - Get the minimum fan system air flow: `min_air_flow = hvac.fan_system.minimum_airflow`  
        - Get the minimum fan system OA flow: `min_OA_flow = hvac.fan_system.minimum_outdoor_airflow` 
        - Check if it was modeled as a 100% outdoor air unit: `if max_OA_flow == min_OA_flow and min_OA_flow == design_supply_flow: modeled_100_percent_OA = true`  
        - Check if it possbily may have been modeled as a 100% outdoor air unit: `if if max_OA_flow == design_supply_flow and min_OA_flow == min_air_flow: possibly_modeled_100_percent_OA = true`  
        - Check if it is NOT likely that it was not modeled as a 100% outdoor air unit: `if min_OA_flow != min_air_flow: likely_NOT_modeled_100_percent_OA = true`  
        
    - **Rule Assertion:** 
    - Case 1: If the baseline system was modeled with the design supply cfm equal to the maximum OA cfm and the minimum air flow was modeled as the minimum OA flow and all space types are defined and are all lab spaces then pass: `if modeled_100_percent_OA == true and modeled_baseline_total_zone_min_OA_CFM >= modeled_proposed_total_zone_min_OA_CFM and all_lighting_space_types_defined== true: outcome = "PASS" and raise_message "The proposed system serves lab spaces and the baseline system <insert hvac.id> appears to have been modeled as an 100% outdoor air unit per the requirements of Section G3.1.2.5 Exception #4.

    - Case 2: Else if the baseline system was modeled with the design supply cfm equal to the maximum OA cfm and the minimum air flow was modeled as the minimum OA flow and some spaces were defined and equal to lab then pass: `elif modeled_100_percent_OA == true and modeled_baseline_total_zone_min_OA_CFM >= modeled_proposed_total_zone_min_OA_CFM and are_any_lighting_space_types_defined == true: outcome = "PASS" and raise_message "Baseline system <insert hvac.id> appears to have been modeled as an 100% outdoor air unit per the requirements of Section G3.1.2.5 Exception #4; however, not all space types associated with the hvac system were defined in the RMD.

**Notes/Questions:**   
1. I was not sure how exactly to assess whether a unit is 100% OA. I figure it would have to have a design supply cfm that matches the maximum OA cfm and the min supply cfm matching the min OA requirements but I don't think this guarentees 100% OA operation.
