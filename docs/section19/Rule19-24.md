# Airside System – Rule 19-24  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24   
**Rule ID:** 19-24   
 
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied in the proposed design.  
**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE                                            
**Appendix G Section:**  Section G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exception #1 and Section G3.1.2.4.   
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  None  
**Data Lookup:** None   
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. This rule does not apply when no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating()
2. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling()

**Manual Check:** None  

**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Call function to get list of inapplicable HVAC systems due to virtual cooling being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 d : `inapplicable_HVAC_systems_cooling_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling(U_RMI,P_RMI)`
- Call function to get list of inapplicable HVAC systems due to virtual heating being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 c:`inapplicable_HVAC_systems_heating_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating(U_RMI,P_RMI)`
There may be duplicates in the following list of inapplicable hvac systems but it is not impactful
- Combine list of inapplicable hvac systems: `inapplicable_HVAC_systems_list_p = inapplicable_HVAC_systems_cooling_list_p + inapplicable_HVAC_systems_heating_list_p`
- For each HeatingVentilationAirconditioningSystem in the P_RMI check if this check is applicable: `for each hvac_p in P_RMI..HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Check if hvac_p is not in the list of inapplicable systems, if it is not found then carry on with rule logic, if found then the rule outcome is NOT_APPLICABLE for this HVAC system, : `if hvac_p not in inapplicable_HVAC_systems_list_p:`   
        - Get fan operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_p = hvac_p.fan_system.operation_during_occupied`  
        - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = hvac_p.fan_system.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  

        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: If the fan system operation during occupied periods is continuous and the minimum OA is greater than 0 in the P_RMI: `if operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p >0 : PASS`  
        - Case 2: else if, fan system operation during occupied periods is cycling and the minimum OA equals 0 in the P_RMI: `elif: operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 : PASS`  
        - Case 3: Else: `Else: FAIL`  

**Notes/Questions:**
1. Updated the Rule ID from 19-27 to 19-24 on 04/17/2023
