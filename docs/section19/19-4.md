# Section 19 - Rule 19-4             
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-4               
**Rule Description:**  For baseline cooling sizing runs in residential dwelling units, the infiltration, occupants, lighting, gas and electricity using equipment hourly schedule shall be the same as the most used hourly weekday schedule from the annual simulation.  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE     
**Appendix G Section:** Exception to G3.1.2.2.1          
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each Space  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Applies to residential dwelling unit spaces only.  
  
   
**Function Calls:**  
 
1. match_data_element()  
2. get_component_by_id()  I think this is supposed to return the object associated with an ID?
3. get_most_used_weekday_hourly_schedule()  



## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if the space is a residential dwelling unit**  
- For each space in the B_RMI: `for space in B_RMI...Space:`  
    - Check if the lighitng space type is of a residential dwelling unit type, if yes carry on, if not then outcome for this space is NOT_APPLICABLE: `if space.lighting_space_type in ["DWELLING_UNIT"] or space._ventilation_space_type in ["TRANSIENT_RESIDENTIAL_DWELLING_UNIT"]:`  
        - Get the zone that the space is part of start by looping through zones: `for zone in B_RMI.Zone:`  
            - Check if the space is associated with the zone: `if space in zone.spaces: applicable_zone = zone`  
        - Get the infiltration object associated with the zone: `infiltration_obj = applicable_zone.infiltration`  
        - Get the multiplier schedule: `multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,infiltration_obj.multiplier_schedule)`  
        - Get the design_heating_multiplier_schedule: `design_heating_multiplier_sch = multiplier_sch.heating_design_day_sequence`  
        - Get the design_cooling_multiplier_schedule: `design_cooling_multiplier_sch = multiplier_sch.cooling_design_day_sequence`  
        - Get the get_most_used_weekday_hourly_schedule (this will be a list with 24 values for each hour): `most_used_weekday_hourly_schedule = get_most_used_weekday_hourly_schedule(B_RMI, ASHRAE229,multiplier_sch) `

STOPPED because not sure how to extract the typical schecule

            - **Rule Assertion:** 
            - Case 1: If then pass: `if (: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 2: Else if : outome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message ""`  
            - Case 3: Else if : `: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 3: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`


**Notes/Questions:**  
1. 90.1 definition of dwelling unit " a single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation." Not sure any other space types other than dwelling unit meet this definition. 
2. Thought about including an applicability check at the start to see if there are any dwelling units in the building but it would involve looping through each space which is the same thing that the existing app check is doing so I left it out
