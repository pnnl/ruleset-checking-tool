# Airside systems – Rule 19-28 
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24   
**Rule ID:** 19-28    
 
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation in the proposed design shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours excluding HVAC systems that meet Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building exceptions #2 and #3.  

#2 HVAC fans shall remain on during occupied and unoccupied hours in spaces that have health- and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.  
#3 HVAC fans shall remain on during occupied and unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE                                             
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exceptions #s 2 and 3 and Section G3.1.2.4.  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Not applicable to HVAC systems in which there are health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours or to HVAC systems primarily serving computer rooms.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_room()
2. get_hvac_systems_serving_zone_health_safety_vent_reqs()
3. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()  

**Manual Check:** None 

**Rule Logic**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of hvac systems that primarily serve computer rooms: `hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_room(P_RMI)`
- Get list of hvac system that are likely to serves zones that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `hvac_health_safety_unocc_list_p = get_hvac_systems_serving_zone_health_safety_vent_reqs(P_RMI)`
- Create list of inappliable hvac systems: `inapplicable_hvac_sys_list_p = hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p + hvac_health_safety_unocc_list_p`           
- For each hvac_p in P-RMD: `for each hvac_p in P_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`                         
    - Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check (rule outcome is NOT_APPLICABLE if the hvac system is found in the list, if not in the list then carry on with rule logic): `if hvac_p not in inapplicable_hvac_sys_list_p:`
        - Get hvac fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_system.operation_during_unoccupied`  
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling in the P_RMI: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`
        - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system: `Else: FAIL`  

## Note
1. Updated the Rule ID from 19-31 to 19-28 on 04/17/2023
