# Section 19 - Rule 19-7               
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24      
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-7                 
**Rule Description:**  Minimum ventilation system outdoor air intake flow shall be the same for the proposed design and baseline building design except when any of the 4 exceptions defined in Section G3.1.2.5 are met.  
Exceptions included in this RDS:
2. When designing systems in accordance with Standard 62.1, Section 6.2, “Ventilation Rate Procedure,” reduced ventilation airflow rates may be calculated for each HVAC zone in the proposed design with a zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) > 1.0 as defined by Standard 62.1, Table 6-2. Baseline ventilation airflow rates in those zones shall be calcu-lated using the proposed design Ventilation Rate Procedure calculation with the following change only. Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be changed to (Ez) = 1.0 in each zone having a zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) > 1.0. Proposed design and baseline build-ing design Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations, as described in Standard 62.1, shall be submitted to the rating authority to claim credit for this exception.

## Rule Logic:   
- Create dictionary of hvac systems and associated zones and terminal units for the baseline: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(B_RMI)`   
- For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`  
    - Reset was_DCV_modeled_baseline boolean variable to false: `was_DCV_modeled_baseline = false`  
    - Reset was_DCV_modeled_proposed boolean variable to false: `was_DCV_modeled_proposed = false`  
    - Reset zone_air_distribution_effectiveness_greater_than_1 boolean to false: `zone_air_distribution_effectiveness_greater_than_1 = false`  
    - Reset hvac_system_serves_only_labs boolean variable to true: `hvac_system_serves_only_labs = true`  
    - Reset all_lighting_space_types_defined boolean variable to true: `all_lighting_space_types_defined = true`  
    - Reset are_any_lighting_space_types_defined boolean variable to true: `are_any_lighting_space_types_defined = false`  
    - Check if demand controlled ventilation was modeled at the fan_system: `if hvac.fan_system.demand_control_ventilation_control == true: was_DCV_modeled_baseline= true`  
    - **Applicability Check 1** - Check that the HVAC system does not only serve labs (covered by 19-39)
    - Get list of zones served by the hvac system: `zones_list_hvac_sys_b = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
        - For each space associated with the zone, check if any spaces are NOT labs or if any lighting space types are not defined: `for space in zone.spaces:`
            - Check if hvac_system_serves_only_labs = true (no need to keep looping through space types if it equals false): `if hvac_system_serves_only_labs == true:`  
                - Check if the lighting space type is defined: `if space.lighting_space_type == Null: all_lighting_space_types_defined = false`    
                - if the lighting space type is not defined: `else:`   
                    - Set are_any_lighting_space_types_defined = true: `are_any_lighting_space_types_defined = true`  
                    - Check if the lighting space type is NOT a lab: `if space.lighting_space_type not in [LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM]: hvac_system_serves_only_labs = false`    
                - Else (i.e., space.lighting_space_type = Null), set all_lighting_space_types_defined = true: `all_lighting_space_types_defined = false`   

    - Check if hvac_system_serves_only_labs = false or if hvac_system_serves_only_labs = false but not all (or any) space types are defined, if false carry on, if true then NOT_APPLICABLE outcome for this HVAC system: `if hvac_system_serves_only_labs == false or (hvac_system_serves_only_labs == true and all_lighting_space_types_defined == false):`        
        - Set counter equal to 0: `counter = 0`  
        - For each zone associated with the HVAC system: `for zone in zones_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
            - Add each zone's OA CFM schedule to the list of zone OA CFM schedules for the baseline: `zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_b[counter] = get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone(B_RMI, zone.id)`  
            - Get the analogous zone object from the proposed RMI (if this is not strictly the correct syntax please advise Weili): `zone_p = get_component_by_id(P_RMI,match_data_element(P_RMI,Zone,zone.id))`    
            - Add each zone's OA CFM schedule to the list of zone OA CFM schedules for the proposed: `zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_p[counter] = get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone(P_RMI, zone_p.id)`  

            - For each terminal unit serving the zone, check if DCV was modeled: `for terminal in zone.terminals:`  
                - Check if DCV was modeled: `if terminal.has_demand_control_ventilation == true: was_DCV_modeled_baseline = true`  
            
            - Check if the air distribution effectiveness is greater than 1 in the proposed: `if zone_p.air_distribution_effectiveness >1: zone_air_distribution_effectiveness_greater_than_1 = true`  

            - For each terminal unit serving the zone in the proposed, check if DCV was modeled: `for terminal in zone_p.terminals:`  
                - Check if DCV was modeled: `if terminal.has_demand_control_ventilation == true: was_DCV_modeled_proposed = true`  
                - Check if the hvac system serving the terminal unit has dcv modeled (weili may have to include some logic to get the hvac object from the id): `if terminal.served_by_heating_ventilating_air_conditioning_system.fan_system.demand_control_ventilation_control != "None": was_DCV_modeled_proposed`  
            
            - Add to counter: `counter = counter + 1`  

        - Create aggregated OA CFM schedule for the baseline for the zones served by the hvac system: `aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_b = aggregate_min_OA_schedule_across_zones(B_RMI,zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_b)`  
        - Create aggregated OA CFM schedule for the proposed for the zones served by the baseline hvac system: `aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_p = aggregate_min_OA_schedule_across_zones(P_RMI,zone_OA_CFM_list_of_schedules_p)`  

        - Reset OA_CFM_schedules_match boolean variable to True: `OA_CFM_schedules_match = True`  
        - Check if schedules mismatch for any hours of the year, if so set boolean to false: `for p to Range(8760):`  
            - Check if the baseline and proposed schedules mismatch: `if aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_b[p] != aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_p[p]: OA_CFM_schedule_match = false`   

        - Sum OA CFM across baseline schedule to get the total for comparison purposes in the rule assertions: `modeled_baseline_total_zone_min_OA_CFM = sum(aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_b)`  
        - Sum OA CFM across proposed schedule to get the total for comparison purposes in the rule assertions: `modeled_proposed_total_zone_min_OA_CFM = sum(aggregated_min_OA_schedule_across_zones_p)`
