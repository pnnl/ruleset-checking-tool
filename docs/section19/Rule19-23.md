## Rule Logic:   
- For each space in the B_RMI: `for space in B_RMD...Space:`  
    - Reset is_dwelling_unit boolean variable: `is_dwelling_unit = false`  
    - Reset is_space_type_defined boolean variable: `is_space_type_defined = false`  
    - Reset the building area defined boolean variable to false: `bldg_area_is_defined = false`  
    - Reset the building_area_is_MF boolean variable to false: `building_area_is_MF = false`  
    - Loop through the building segments to determine which building segment the zone is apart of: `for bldg_seg in B_RMI...Building.building_segments:`  
        - Check if the zone is in bldg_seg.zones, if yes then set the bldg_type to the building area lighting type associated with the building segment: `if applicable_zone in bldg_seg.zones: bldg_type = bldg_seg.lighting_building_area_type`
        - Check if the lighting building area type was defined: `if bldg_type != Null: bldg_area_is_defined = true`  
        - Check if the lighting building area type is multifamily: `if bldg_type in ["MULTIFAMILY"]: building_area_is_MF = true`
