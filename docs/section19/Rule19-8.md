**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem Data Group  

**Applicability Checks:** None  

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area()  


## Rule Logic:  
- Get dictionary with hvac systems and associated zones and areas: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_b  = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area(B_RMR)`  
- For each hvac_b system in B_RMI: `for hvac_b in hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_b:`  
    - Reset is_DCV_modeled to FALSE: `is_DCV_modeled = FALSE`  
    - Reset avg_occ_density to 0: `avg_occ_density = 0`  
    - Get the hvac system minimum OA flow: `hvac_min_OA_flow = hvac_b.fan_system.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
    - Check whether DCV was modeled: `if hvac_b.fan_system.demand_control_ventilation_control != Null AND hvac_b.fan_system.demand_control_ventilation_control != "NONE": is_DCV_modeled_b = TRUE`  
    - Check whether the outdoor air capacity (i.e., minimum OA CFM) is greater than 3,000 cfm, if yes then carry on: `if hvac_min_OA_flow > 3000:`  
        - Get list of zones served: `zone_list_b = list(hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_b[hvac_b.id]["Zone_List"].values())`  
        - Get area served by the the HVAC system: `hvac_area_b = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_b[hvac_b.id]["TOTAL_AREA"]`  
        - Reset total_hvac_sys_occupants_b to zero: `total_hvac_sys_occupants_b = 0`  
        - For each zone associated with the HVAC system, get the number of occupants associated with the hvac system by looping through all the associated zones and spaces: `for zone_b in zone_list_b:`         
            - Reset total_occ_num_across_spaces_b: `total_occ_num_across_spaces_b = 0`  
            - For each space associated with the zone, get the number of occupants associated with the space: `for space_b in zone_b.spaces:`  
                - Get number of occupants: `max_number_occ_b = space_b.number_of_occupants`   
                - Add to the total occupants across all spaces: `total_occ_num_across_spaces_b = total_occ_num_across_spaces_b + max_number_occ_b`  
            - Add to the total number of occs associated with the HVAC system: `total_hvac_sys_occupants_b = total_hvac_sys_occupants_b + total_occ_num_across_spaces_b`  
        - Calculate the average occupant density associated with the HVAC system: `avg_occ_density = total_hvac_sys_occupants_b/hvac_area_b`  
    - **Rule Assertion:** 
    - Case 1: If hvac_min_OA_flow > 3000 AND occupant density > 0.1 AND is_DCV_modeled_b == TRUE then pass: `If hvac_min_OA_flow > 3000 AND avg_occ_density > 0.1 AND is_DCV_modeled_b == TRUE: outcome = "PASS"`  
    - Case 2: Else If hvac_min_OA_flow <= 3000 OR occupant density <= 0.1 AND is_DCV_modeled_b == FALSE then pass: `elif hvac_min_OA_flow <= 3000 OR avg_occ_density >= 0.1 AND is_DCV_modeled_b == FALSE: outcome = "PASS"`
    - Case 3: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`  


**Notes/Questions:**  
1. On 1/11/2023 modified average design (occupant) capacity to equal the sum of the design # of occs across spaces divided by the total area served. I drafted an interpretation request to be submitted to 90.1 to get a definitive answer as to how this should be determined. 
2. Rule changed from 19-12 to 19-8 on 10/18/2022.
3. Modified on 11/19/2022 such that Space.number_of_occupants equals the design number of occupants (i.e., removed schedule multiplier)  .
