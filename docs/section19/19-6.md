# Section 19 - Rule 19-6      
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  
**Mandatory Rule:** True      
**Rule ID:** 19-6         
**Rule Description:** Unmet load hours for the baseline design shall not exceed 300 (of the 8760 hours simulated).      
**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail     
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.3        
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Each Baseline Design 0 Degree Rotation RulesetModelInstance  (should only be one per project)

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applies only to the baseline design (no rotation) rule set model instance.  

**Function Calls:**  None  

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each RulesetModelInstance in ASHRAE229.ruleset_model_instance : `for RulesetModelInstance in ASHRAE229.ruleset_model_instance:`  
    - Check if the ruleset model instance is the no rotation baseline model instance: `If RulesetModelInstance.ruleset_model_type = "BASELINE_0":`  
        - Get the heating unmet load hours for the rule set model instance: `unmet_load_hours_heating = RulesetModelInstance.OutputInstance.unmet_load_hours_heating`  
        - Get the cooling unmet load hours for the rule set model instance: `unmet_load_hours_cooling = RulesetModelInstance.OutputInstance.unmet_load_hours_cooling`  

        **Rule Assertion:** 
        - Case 1: If the heating + cooling unmet load hours is 300 or less then pass: `if unmet_load_hours_heating + unmet_load_hours_cooling <= 300: outcome = "PASS"`   
        - Case 2: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`  

**Notes/Questions:**  
1. Does this apply at the ruleset model instance level as I created it? I wasn't sure how to reference the output schema. I took a shot at it here. 
2. Do we check this for each rotation of the baseline model or just 0 degrees (i.e., as-designed orientation)? When I do reviews I only check the design orientation but I want to make sure that is correct.
