# Section 19 - Rule 19-13             
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24      
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-13             
**Rule Description:** For baseline system types 1-8 and 11-13, system design supply airflow rates shall be based on a supply-air-to-room temperature set-point difference of 20°F or the minimum outdoor airflow rate, or the airflow rate required to comply with applicable codes or accreditation standards, whichever is greater. For systems with multiple zone thermostat setpoints, use the design set point that will result in the lowest supply air cooling set point or highest supply air heating set point.  

Exceptions:
1. For baseline system types 1-8 and 11-13, for systems serving laboratory spaces, airflow rate shall be based on a supply-air-to-room temperature set-point difference of 17°F or the required ventilation air or makeup air, whichever is greater.
2. For baseline system types 1-8, 11-13, if the proposed design HVAC system airflow rate based on latent loads is greater than the design airflow rate based on sensible loads, then the same supply-air-to-room-air humidity ratio difference (gr/lb) used to calculate the proposed design airflow shall be used to calculate design airflow rates for the baseline building design.

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE    
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.8.1 and Exceptions 1 and 2           
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Applies to baseline HVAC system types 1-8 and 11-13.   
2. Does not apply to systems serving laboratory spaces.  
   
   
**Function Calls:**  
1. get_baseline_system_types()    
2. baseline_system_type_compare()

## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
- Create a list of the target system types: `target_system_types = [HVAC_SYS.SYS_1, HVAC_SYS.SYS_2, HVAC_SYS.SYS_3, HVAC_SYS.SYS_4, HVAC_SYS.SYS_5, HVAC_SYS.SYS_6, HVAC_SYS.SYS_7, HVAC_SYS.SYS_8, HVAC_SYS.SYS_11, HVAC_SYS.SYS_12, HVAC_SYS.SYS_13]`  
- Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMI)`  
- Check if B-RMI is modeled with at least one applicable air-side system, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the project: `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(system_type, target_sys_type, false) for system_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for target_system_type in target_system_types):` 
    - Create dictionary of hvac systems and associated zones and terminal units: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(B_RMI)`  
    - For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:` 
        - Reset all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs boolean to true: `all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs = true`  
        - Get the baseline system type: `sys_type = list(baseline_system_types_dict.keys())[list(baseline_system_types_dict.values()).index(hvac.id)])`
        - Check if system type is of an applicable system type, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system:  `if any(baseline_system_type_compare(sys_type, target_sys_type, false) for target_system_type in target_system_types):`      
            - Get list of zones served by the hvac system: `zones_list_hvac_sys_b = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
            - Get list of terminal units served by the hvac system: `terminal_list_hvac_sys_b = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]["Terminal_Unit_List"]`  

            Below determines the zone setpoint to use in the delta T calculation for systems with multiple zone thermostat setpoints, use the design set point that will result in the lowest supply air cooling set point or highest supply air heating set point: 
            - Reset the design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint variable from the previous HVAC system: `design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint = +infinity`  
            - Reset the design_thermostat_heating_setpoint variable from the previous HVAC system: `design_thermostat_heating_setpoint = -infinity`  
            - Cycle through each zone associated with the HVAC system to get the lowest design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint and the highest design_thermostat_heating_setpoint: `for zone in zones_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
                - Check if the zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint is less than the design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint: `if zone.zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint < design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint:` 
                    - Set the design setpoint equal to the zone design setpoint: `design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint = zone.zone_design_thermostat_cooling`  
                - Check if the zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint is greater than the design_thermostat_heating_setpoint: `if zone.zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint > design_thermostat_heating_setpoint:`  
                    - Set the design setpoint equal to the zone design setpoint: `design_thermostat_heating_setpoint = zone.zone_design_thermostat_heating`  
            
            Below checks for a delta T of 20F:
            - For each zone in the list of zones served by the hvac system: `for zone in zones_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
                - Reset zone has lab space boolean variable: `zone_has_lab_space = false`  
                - For each space in zone: `for space in zone.spaces:`
                    - Check if space is a lab based on lighting_space_type: `if space.lighting_space_type in ["LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM"]: zone_has_lab_space = true`
                - For each terminal unit associated with the zone: `for terminal in zone.terminals:`  
                    - Check if the terminal unit is associated with the hvac system: `if terminal in terminal_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
                        - Get the design heating supply temperature setpoint: `design_heating_supply_air_temp_setpoint = terminal.supply_design_heating_setpoint_temperature` 
                        - Get the design cooling supply temperature setpoint: `design_cooling_supply_air_temp_setpoint = terminal.supply_design_cooling_setpoint_temperature` 
                        - Check if the zone serves at least one lab space: `if zone_has_lab_space == true:`  
                            - Check if the delta temperature is NOT 17F for heating: `if design_heating_supply_air_temp_setpoint-zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint != 17:all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs = false`  
                            - Check if the delta temperature is NOT 17F for cooling: `if zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint - design_cooling_supply_air_temp_setpoin != 17:all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs = false`  
                        - Else, zone does not serve a lab space: `Else:`  
                            - Check if the delta temperature is NOT 20F for heating: `if design_heating_supply_air_temp_setpoint-zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint != 20:all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs = false`  
                            - Check if the delta temperature is NOT 20F for cooling: `if zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint - design_cooling_supply_air_temp_setpoin != 20:all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs = false`  

        - **Rule Assertion:** 
        - Case 1: If the supply-air-to-room temperature set-point difference equals 20°F or 17F per G3.1.2.8.1 including Exceptions 1, the fan is autosized and the FanSystem.minimum_airflow>FanSystem.Minimum_Outdoor_Airflow: `if all_design_setpoints_delta_Ts_are_per_reqs == true and are_all_hvac_sys_fan_objs_autosized(B_RMI, hvac) == True : outcome = "PASS"`  
        - Case 2: Else, Fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail and raise_message "The hvac system cfm does not appear to have been autosized based on a supply-air-to-room temperature set-point difference equal to 20° or 17° (in the case of hvac systems serving laboratory spaces per G3.1.2.8.1 Exception #1) for [insert hvac.id]. Fail unless the supply airflow rates were set based on minimum outdoor airflow rates or the airflow rate required to comply with applicable codes or accreditation standards, whichever is greater or per G3.1.2.8.1 Exception #2 which states that if the proposed design HVAC system airflow rate based on latent loads is greater than the design airflow rate based on sensible loads, then the same supply-air-to-room-air humidity ratio difference (gr/lb) used to calculate the proposed design airflow shall be used to calculate design airflow rates for the baseline building design. Recommend a manual check to see if this applies."`
