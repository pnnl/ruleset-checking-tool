# Section 19 - Rule 19-13           
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-13           
**Rule Description:** For baseline system types 1-8 and 11-13, system design supply airflow rates shall be based on a supply-air-to-room temperature set-point difference of 20Â°F or the minimum outdoor airflow rate, or the airflow rate required to comply with applicable codes or accreditation standards, whichever is greater.  For systems with multiple zone thermostat setpoints, use the design set point that will result in the lowest supply air cooling set point or highest supply air heating set point. 

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/UNDETERMINED/NOT_APPLICABLE    
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.8.1         
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:**  
1. Applies to baseline HVAC system types 1-8 and 11-13.     
   
   

**Function Calls:**  
1. get_baseline_system_types  
2. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area    


## Rule Logic:   
**Applicability Check 1 - Check if there are any Applicable Baseline System Types in the Project at All**   
- Create dictionary of baseline system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMI)`  
- Check if B-RMI is modeled with at least one air-side system that is of system type 3 through 8, or 11, 12, and 13, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for all HVAC systems: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-1","SYS-1a","SYS-1b","SYS-1c", "SYS-2","SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4", "SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b","SYS-7", "SYS-7a", "SYS-7b", "SYS-7c","SYS-8", "SYS-8a", "SYS-8b", "SYS-8c","SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.1a", "SYS-11b", "SYS-11c","SYS-11.2","SYS-11.2a","SYS-12", "SYS-12a", "SYS-12b", "SYS-12c","SYS-13", "SYS-13a"]):`
    - Create dictionary with HVAC systems and a zone list: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area(B_RMI)`  
    - For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:` 
        - Check if system type is of an applicable system type, if yes then carry on, if no then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system:  `If any(hvac.id in baseline_hvac_system_dict[sys_type] for sys_type in ["SYS-1","SYS-1a","SYS-1b","SYS-1c", "SYS-2","SYS-3", "SYS-3a", "SYS-3b", "SYS-3c", "SYS-4", "SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b","SYS-7", "SYS-7a", "SYS-7b", "SYS-7c","SYS-8", "SYS-8a", "SYS-8b", "SYS-8c","SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.1a", "SYS-11b", "SYS-11c","SYS-11.2","SYS-11.2a","SYS-12", "SYS-12a", "SYS-12b", "SYS-12c","SYS-13", "SYS-13a"]): `    
            - Get list of zones associated with the HVAC system: `zone_list = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
            - Reset the design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint variable from the previous HVAC system (not sure how to do this with a numeric variable): `design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint = ""`  
            - Reset the design_thermostat_heating_setpoint variable from the previous HVAC system (not sure how to do this with a numeric variable): `design_thermostat_heating_setpoint = ""`  
            - Reset counter variable: `x=0`
            - Cycle through each zone associated with the HVAC system to get the lowest design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint and the highest design_thermostat_heating_setpoint: `for zone in zone_list:`  
                - Get zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint: `zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint = zone.design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint`
                - Get zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint: `zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint = zone.design_thermostat_heating_setpoint`
                - Check if x = 0, this means this is the first zone associated with the HVAC system: `if x == 0:`  
                    - Set the design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint equal to this zone's value: `design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint = zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint`
                    - Set the design_thermostat_heating_setpoint equal to this zone's value: `design_thermostat_heating_setpoint = zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint`     
                - Else, means that this is not the first zone so need to compare this zone's values to the current values: `Else:`  
                    - Check if the zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint is less than the design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint: `if zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint < design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint: design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint =  zone_design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint`                 
                    - Check if the zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint is greater than the design_thermostat_heating_setpoint: `if zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint > design_thermostat_heating_setpoint: design_thermostat_heating_setpoint =  zone_design_thermostat_heating_setpoint`         
            - Get hvac system type: `hvac_sys_type_b = baseline_system_types_dict.keys()[list(baseline_system_types_dict.values()).index(hvac.id)]` 
            - Check if the baseline system type has terminal units as this will influence the check: `if hvac_sys_type_b in ["SYS-5", "SYS-5b", "SYS-6", "SYS-6b","SYS-7", "SYS-7a", "SYS-7b", "SYS-7c","SYS-8", "SYS-8a", "SYS-8b", "SYS-8c"]:`

                - I am tripped up now. Below appear to be the relevant data elements but I am not sure how to access this given the supply temperatures will be different depending on whether heating or cooling is needed. This applies to both MZ system with reheat and single zone systems without reheat.
