# Section 19 - Rule 19-7               
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23    
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 19-7                 
**Rule Description:**  Minimum ventilation system outdoor air intake flow shall be the same for the proposed design and baseline building design except when any of the 4 exceptions defined in Section G3.1.2.5 are met.  
Exceptions
1. When modeling demand control ventilation in the proposed design in systems with outdoor air capacity less than or equal to 3000 cfm serving areas with an average design capacity of 100 people per 1000 ft^2 or less.  
2. When designing systems in accordance with Standard 62.1, Section 6.2, “Ventilation Rate Procedure,” reduced ventilation airflow rates may be calculated for each HVAC zone in the proposed design with a zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) > 1.0 as defined by Standard 62.1, Table 6-2. Baseline ventilation airflow rates in those zones shall be calcu-lated using the proposed design Ventilation Rate Procedure calculation with the following change only. Zone air distribution effectiveness shall be changed to (Ez) = 1.0 in each zone having a zone air distribution effectiveness (Ez) > 1.0. Proposed design and baseline build-ing design Ventilation Rate Procedure calculations, as described in Standard 62.1, shall be submitted to the rating authority to claim credit for this exception. M
3. Where the minimum outdoor air intake flow in the proposed design is provided in excess of the amount required by the building code or the rating authority, the baseline building design shall be modeled to reflect the greater of that required by either the rating authority or the building code and will be less than the proposed design. 
4. For baseline systems serving only laboratory spaces that are prohibited from recirculating return air by code or accreditation standards, the baseline system shall be modeled as 100% outdoor air. 

**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/UNDETERMINED      
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.5 and Exceptions 1-4           
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None    

**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:**  None
   
**Function Calls:**  
1. get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys()    
2. match_data_element()  
3. get_component_by_id()  
4. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()  


## Rule Logic:   
- Create dictionary of hvac systems and associated zones and terminal units for the baseline: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(B_RMI)`   
- Create dictionary of hvac systems and associated zones and terminal units for the proposed: `dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_p = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(P_RMI)`  
- For each hvac system in the B_RMI: `for hvac in B_RMI...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`  
    - Reset was_DCV_modeled boolean variable to false: `was_DCV_modeled = false`  
    
    - Reset modeled_proposed_total_zone_OA_CFM to zero: `modeled_proposed_total_zone_OA_CFM =0`  
    - Reset modeled_baseline_total_zone_OA_CFM to zero: `modeled_baseline_total_zone_OA_CFM =0` 
    - Get list of zones served by the hvac system: `zones_list_hvac_sys_b = dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys_b[hvac.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
    - For each zone in the B_RMI aggregate the analogous zone's terminal units' minimum outdoor airflow CFM in the baseline, do the same for the proposed: `for zone in zones_list_hvac_sys_b:`  
        - For each terminal unit serving the zone, add the minimum OA cfm to the modeled_baseline_total_zone_OA_CFM: `for terminal in zone.terminals: modeled_baseline_total_zone_OA_CFM = modeled_baseline_total_zone_OA_CFM + terminal.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
        - Get the analogous zone object from the proposed RMI (if this is not strictly the correct syntax please advise Weili): `zone_p = get_component_by_id(P_RMI,match_data_element(P_RMI,Zone,zone.id))`    
        - For each terminal unit serving the zone, add the minimum OA cfm to the modeled_proposed_total_zone_OA_CFM: `for terminal in zone_p.terminals: modeled_proposed_total_zone_OA_CFM = modeled_proposed_total_zone_OA_CFM + terminal.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
        
            




            - **Rule Assertion:** 
            - Case 1: If return or relief fans are specified in the proposed design (but not both) and the baseline building design is modeled with fans serving the same functions and sized for the baseline system supply fan air quantity less the minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air quantity, whichever is larger then pass: `if (all(is_modeled_with_return_fan_in_proposed, is_modeled_with_relief_fan_in_proposed) == false) and (is_modeled_with_return_fan_in_proposed == true or is_modeled_with_relief_fan_in_proposed == true) and (modeled_cfm == max(supply_minus_OA_cfm,90_percent_supply_cfm)): outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 2: Else if both return or relief fans are specified in the proposed design then outcome is UNDETERMINED: `elif all(is_modeled_with_return_fan_in_proposed, is_modeled_with_relief_fan_in_proposed) == true: outome = "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "Return and relief fans both appear to be modeled in the proposed design, conduct manual check that the baseline building design is modeled with fans serving the same functions and sized for the baseline system supply fan air quantity less the minimum outdoor air, or 90% of the supply fan air quantity, whichever is larger per Section G3.1.2.8.1."`  
            - Case 3: Else if no return or relief fans were modeled in the proposed design model and no cfm was modeled for return or relief fans in the baseline model then pass: `elif is_modeled_with_return_fan_in_proposed == false and is_modeled_with_relief_fan_in_proposed == false and fan_sys_CFM[1] == 0 and fan_sys_CFM[3] == 0: outcome = "PASS"`  
            - Case 3: Else, fail: `Else: outcome = "Fail"`


**Notes/Questions:**  
1. For figuring out the proposed OA CFM the easiest way than using the terminal unit unless the HVAC system is a single zone unit but in the proposed there could be a combo which complicates it.
