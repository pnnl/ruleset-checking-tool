# Section 19 - Rule 19-37 
**Schema Version:** 0.1.3  
**Mandatory Rule:** False    
**Rule ID:** 19-3     
**Rule Description:** Actual weather conditions used in sizing runs for the 99.6% heating design temperature and 1% dry-bulb and 1% wet-bulb cooling design temperatures are consistent with the site location.    
**Rule Assertion:** Options are UNDETERMINED/NOT_APPLICABLE     
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1.2.2.1      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Each RulesetProjectDescription

**Applicability Checks:** None  

**Function Calls:**  None

## Check Applicability:
- Set default applicability: `rule_applicability = True`  
- Get the weather for the ruleset project description: `weather = RulesetProjectDescription.weather`  
- If the design days were incorrectly defined in terms of type in thr RPD then rule is NOT_APPLICABLE: `if not (weather.cooling_dry_bulb_temp_design_day_type == "COOLING_1_0" and weather.heating_dry_bulb_temp_design_day_type == "HEATING_99_6" and weather.cooling_wet_bulb_temp_design_day_type == "COOLING_1_0"):`  
  - Rule is not applicable because why check actual temps if definitions are not correct: `rule_applicability = False`   
- Else, continue with rule logic: `else:`  

## Rule Logic:

- **Rule Assertion:**
- Case 1: If rule is applicable, need to conduct manual check that the correct temperatures were for the sizing runs; outcome=UNDETERMINED:  `if rule_applicability: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "Check that the actual temperatures used in sizing runs to determine baseline equipment capacities is based on design days developed using 99.6% heating design temperatures and 1% dry-bulb and 1% wet-bulb cooling design temperatures appropriate for the site location."`  
- Case 2: Else, NOT_APPLICABLE: `else: NOT_APPLICABLE`

**Notes/Questions:**  
1. This logic assumes the suggestion in Issue #327 will be implemented in the schema.
2. If we do not like this applicability check (I know it is a little different then our typical approach), I can check if there are any HVAC systems and if there are any then the check is always applicable. If not, then it is NOT_APPLICABLE.
