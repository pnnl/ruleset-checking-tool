# Airside Systems – Rule 19-31  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24    
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 19-31  
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans in the proposed design model shall remain on during unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  
**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE                                          
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #3 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to hvac systems primarily serving computer rooms.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_room()

**Manual Check:** None  
 
**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of hvac systems that primary serve computer rooms: `hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_room(P_RMI)`
- For each hvac_p in hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p (if not in the list then rule outcome is NOT_APPLICABLE): `for hvac_p in hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p:`
    - Get operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_system.operation_during_unoccupied`  
    - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = hvac_p.fan_system.minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR and OA CFM >0: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS” AND minimum_outdoor_airflow_p > 0: PASS`
    - Case 2: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is intermittent in the P_RMR and OA CFM =0: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING” AND minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = 0: PASS`
    - Case 3: Else, for each applicable hvac system system: `Else: FAIL` 

## Note
1. Updated the Rule ID from 19-34 to 19-31 on 04/17/2023
