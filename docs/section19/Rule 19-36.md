# Airside Systems â€“ Rule 19-36  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.24    
**Mandatory Rule:** False  
**Rule ID:** 19-36  
**Rule Description:** Where no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d, heating and/or cooling system fans shall simulated to be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during occupied hours in the proposed design.  
**Rule Assertion:** Options are NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED                                             
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules Exception #1 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirAconditioningSystem  
**Applicability Checks:**

1. Applicable if no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating()
2. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling()

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**
- Call function to get list of applicable HVAC systems due to virtual cooling being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 d : `applicable_HVAC_systems_cooling_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling(U_RMI,P_RMI)`
- Call function to get list of applicable HVAC systems due to virtual heating being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 c:`applicable_HVAC_systems_heating_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating(U_RMI,P_RMI)`
- Combine list of applicable hvac systems, there may be duplicates in the list of inapplicable hvac systems but it is not impactful: `applicable_HVAC_systems_list_p = applicable_HVAC_systems_cooling_list_p + applicable_HVAC_systems_heating_list_p`
- For each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem in the P_RMI: `for each hvac_p in P_RMI..HeatingVentilatingAirAconditioningSystem:`
    - Check if hvac_p is in the list of applicable systems, if it is found then carry on, if not found then NOT_APPLICABLE for the hvac system: `if hvac_p in applicable_HVAC_systems_list_p:`   
        - Get operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_p = hvac_p.fan_system.operation_during_occupied`  

        **Rule Assertion:**  
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system: `outcome == "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "It appears that <insert hvac_p.d> is only being simulated in the P_RMI to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d. Check that the heating and/or cooling system fans are simulated to be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and/or cooling loads during occupied hours as applicable. Note that per the RMD the fan associated with <insert hvac_b.id> is operating as <insert operation_during_occupied_b> during occupied hours. This may require further investigation if only heating or cooling is being simulated to meet Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c or d because different fan operation will be required depending on whether the system is operating in heating or cooling mode. "`  
    
**Notes**  
1. The reason this is UNDETERMINED is because if just heating or just cooling is modeled to meet the requirements of Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d we cannot assess from the schema whether the fans are being modeled as cycling with load for just heating or just cooling.
