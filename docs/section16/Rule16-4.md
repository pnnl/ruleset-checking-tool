# Elevators â€“ Rule 16-4  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36        
**Mandatory Rule:** True          
**Rule ID:** 16-4  
**Rule Description:** The elevator cab lights shall be modeled with the same schedule as the elevator motor.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMD = Expected Value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** G3.1  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1-16 Proposed Building Performance    
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Each elevator  

**Applicability Checks:**  
  1. The proposed building has an elevator.  

**Function Call:**  
compare_schedules

**Applicability Check 1:**
- Rule is applicable if any building in the proposed RMD has an elevator: `if any(len(building.elevators) > 0 for building in P_RMD...buildings:`

## Rule Logic:
- Determine if the project schedule uses a leap year: `is_leap_year = RPD.calendar.is_leap_year`
- If it is a leap year, set the schedule comparison mask to 8784 hours, else set it to 8760 hours: `mask_schedule = [1] * 8784 if is_leap_year else [1] * 8760`
- For each elevator in the proposed RMD: `for elevator in P_RMD...elevators`
  - Get the modeled schedule for the elevator motor use in the proposed: `motor_use_schedule_p = elevator_p.cab_motor_multiplier_schedule`
  - Get the modeled schedule for the elevator cab lighting use in the proposed: `cab_lighting_schedule_p = elevator_p.cab_lighting_multiplier_schedule`
  - Compare the schedules: `comparison_data = compare_schedules(cab_lighting_schedule_p, motor_use_schedule_p, mask_schedule, is_leap_year):`  

  **Rule Assertion:**  
    - Case 1: If the schedules match for all hours: `if comparison_data['total_hours_matched'] == len(cab_lighting_schedule_p) == len(motor_use_schedule_p): PASS`
    - Case 2: Else: `FAIL`
