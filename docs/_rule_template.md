The following provides a template with general instructions for creating a Rule Definition Strategy (RDS) document for defining rules in the Ruleset Checking Tool.  

# <SECTION_NAME> - Rule <RULE_ID>
**Schema Version:** 0.0.10
**Mandatory Rule:** True/False  
**Rule ID:** The unique string identifier used to identify the rule within the ruleset.  
**Rule Description:** A textual description of the rule intended to be human readable. This description is included in the output JSON created by the RCT.  
**Rule Assertion:** The logical assertion that is applied to determine the outcome of a rule evaluation. Options are []   
**Appendix G Section:** The section number reference to the rule within Standard 90.1. e.g., *Section G3.1-5(b) Building Envelope Modeling Requirements for the Baseline building.*    
**90.1 Section Reference:** None

```markdown
Notes:
- A list of references to other sections of 90.1 used by the rule.
- Use *None* if no references are required. 
```

**Data Lookup:** 
- Tables G3.4-1 to G3.4-8

```markdown
Notes:
A reference to specific data tables within ASHRAE 90.1 that are required for the rule evaluation.  
```

**Evaluation Context:** Each Data Element

```markdown
Notes:
A string signifying at what level with the RMR data tree the rule evaluation must occur. Options are *Each Data Element* and *Data Group*. 
- When defined as *Each Data Element* the rule entire scope of the rule evaluation occurs at each data element in the defined group. This implies a separate applicability check, manual check, and rule assertion for each data element. An individual output is written for each data element within the group.
- A rule that is evaluated at a *Data Group* is evaluated once for the relevant data group. This type of evaluation usually involves aggregating or calculating values up to the data group level prior to applying the assertion. A single output is written for the entire data group evaluation.  
```

**Applicability Checks:**
1. Applicability check #1 - Excludes computer rooms and health/safety rooms.
2. Applicability check #2

```markdown
Notes:
- A list of all applicability checks with brief narrative description.  
- Implementation of applicability check should be included within the rule logic section of the RDS.
- Applicability check should be formatted as an enumerated list.
```

**Function Calls:**  
1. ruleset_function_1() 
2. ruleset_function_2()

```markdown
Notes:
- A list of all functions that this rule utilizes.  
- Functions should be formatted as an enumerated list.
```

## Rule Logic:
  ```markdown
- The Rule Logic section defines the logical evaluation of a rule using pseudocode. This description is used to develop the Rule Definition code in the RCT representing the rule.  
    - A nested list structure should be used to denote code that operates iteratively, such as within a For Loop.
        - Further nesting can be used, if required to iterate through data elements in the RMR file.
```

**Applicability Check 1:** `(Example) if calculated_value > threshold:`  
    
```markdown
- Applicability Checks should be placed within the appropriate location of the code structure. These checks should be written to affirm whether a rule is applicable to a data element or data group. More than one Applicability Checks may be used, if necessary. 
- The RCT will automatically handle cases that fail the Applicability Checks by outputting a *NOT_APPLICABLE* outcome. No additional description in the RDS is required for cases failing Applicability Checks.
```

- Loop for each building data element: `for b_building in B_RMR.buildings:`
    - Get a zone using abbreviated notation (i.e., ...): `for b_zone in b_building...zones:`
        - Get a data element from the final data group: `b_zone_volume = b_zone.volume`
        - Calculate a value used in final rule assertion: `calculated_value = b_zone_volume`

    ```markdown
    - A Rule Assertion should be provided where appropriate within the code structure. The Rule Assertion should be a simple logical evaluation that is used to determine one of the four possible outcomes for a Rule Evaluation. Examples of possible Rule Assertion outcomes are: *PASS*, *FAIL*, *UNDETERMINED* 
    - A Rule Assertion section should be definined within the appropriate level of the code structure, so that the rule can be evaluated for each relevant data element in the RMR.
    ```  
    - **Rule Assertion:** 
        - Define quantity, unit, precision for the evaluation" `(Example) if calculated_value == expected_value: outcome == "PASS"`
        - Define undetermined case (if applicable): `(Example) elif calculated_value > expected_value: outcome == "UNDETERMINED"` 
        - Add message for manual checks, UNDETERMINED.
        - Define not applicable case: `(Example) elif not Applicability check #2: outcome == "NOT_APPLICABLE"`
        - All other cases will get a failing outcome: `(Example) else: outcome == "FAIL"`
