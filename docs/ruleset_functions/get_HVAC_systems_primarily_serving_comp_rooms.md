# get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms  

**Description:** Returns a list of HVAC systems in which the computer room space loads are the dominant loads for an HVAC system serving multiple spaces including computer rooms and non computer rooms (i.e., computer room spaces accounr for greater than 50% of cooling load).  

**Inputs:**  
- **U,B, or P-RMI**: To develop a list of HVAC systems in which the computer room space loads are the dominant loads for an HVAC system serving multiple spaces including computer rooms and non computer rooms (i.e., computer room spaces accounr for greater than 50% of cooling load). 

**Returns:**  
- **hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_x**: A list of hvac systems in which the computer room space loads are the dominant loads for an HVAC system serving multiple spaces including computer rooms and non computer rooms (i.e., computer room spaces accounr for greater than 50% of cooling load). 
 
**Function Call:**  

1. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area()  
2. zones_with_computer_room_dict_x()  
3. is_space_a_computer_room()  

## Logic:   
- Create RMI object from RMI function input (RMI = function input): `X_RMI = RMI` 
- Create dictionary incuding all zones with at least one computer room: `zone_computer_room_dict = zones_with_computer_room_dict_x(X_RMI)`  
- Create list of zones with at least one computer room: `zone_with_computer_room_list = list(zone_computer_room_dict.keys())`    
- Get dictionary list of zones and the total floor area served by each HVAC system: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_x = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area (X_RMI)`
- For each hvac_x in the X_RMI: `for hvac_x in X_RMI...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Reset hvac system includes computer room boolean variable: `hvac_system_serves_computer_room_space = FALSE` 
    - Reset total_Wattage_across_hvac_sys: `total_Wattage_across_hvac_sys = 0`  
    - Reset total_Wattage_across_hvac_sys_for_computer_room: `total_Wattage_across_hvac_sys_for_computer_room = 0`  
    - Get list of zones served by hvac_x: `hvac_zone_list_x = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_x[hvac_x.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`  
    - For each zone_x in hvac_zone_list_x: `for zone_x in hvac_zone_list_x:`
        - Check if the zone is in the list of zones with at least one computer room, if not loop to next zone: `if zone_x in zone_with_computer_room_list:`  
            - Set hvac system serves computer room boolean variable to true: `hvac_system_serves_computer_room_space = TRUE`  
            - Reset total_Wattage_zone: `total_Wattage_zone = 0`  
            - For each space in zone: `for space_x in zone_x.Spaces:`        
                - Reset space_is_a_computer_room to false: `space_is_a_computer_room = false`  
                - Reset total_Wattage_space: `total_Wattage_space = 0`  
                - Get the area (ft^2) of the space: `area = space.floor_area`  
                - Check if space is of type computer room, if yes then set the space is a computer room boolean variable to true: `if is_space_a_computer_room(RMI,space_x) == true: space_is_a_computer_room = true`  
                
                NOTE: Design day schedules used, these should have the same value for all hours (except for dwelling units which are irrelevant here) so no need to find the coincident peak across the schedules. No need to even find the peak but did just in case there is an odd value in the schedule.

                Occupany Wattage calculation: 
                - Get the multiplier schedule: `multiplier_sch = get_component_by_id(B_RMI,space.occupant_multiplier_schedule)`

**Notes/Questions:**   
1. Interpretation: When computer rooms account for more than 50% of the cooling load of an HVAC system, such HVAC system is considered “primarily serving computer rooms” and is subject to the exception 3 to Table G3.1#4, Proposed Building Performance column HVAC Fans Schedules rule. 
2. Jason plans to add .cooling_design_day_sequence to the schema.
