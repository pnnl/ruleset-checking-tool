**Logic:**
- # Determine if a HVAC system has been designed or modeled as existing in U-RMR for each zone**
- For each zone in U_RMR: `for zone_u in U_RMR...zones:`
    - Reset heating system exists boolean variable equal to false each time it loops to a different zone: `heating_system_exists_is-designed_u = FALSE`
    - Reset cooling system exists boolean variable equal to false each time it loops to a different zone: `cooling_system_exists_is-designed_u = FALSE`
    - Reset heating system exists boolean variable equal to false each time it loops to a different zone: `heating_system_modeled_p = FALSE`
    - Reset cooling system exists boolean variable equal to false each time it loops to a different zone: `cooling_system_modeled_p = FALSE`
    - Check if there are terminal units associated with the zone, if not skip to proposed: `if len(zone_u.terminals) != 0:`
        - For each terminal unit associated with each zone: `for terminal_u in zone_u:`
            - if reheat_source is not null then set heating exists/is designed boolean variable equal to true: `if terminal_u.reheat_source != "None":`
                - Set heating system exists/is designed boolean variable equal to true: `heating_system_exists_is-designed_u = TRUE`
            - if terminal heat_capacity is not zero then set heating exists/is designed boolean variable equal to true: `if terminal_u.heat_capacity != 0:`
                - Set heating system exists/is designed boolean variable equal to true: `heating_system_exists_is-designed_u = TRUE`    
            - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for each terminal: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_u = terminal_u.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`

        - After looping through all terminal units convert the list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_u associated with the zone to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_u = list(set(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_u))`

                    - Set heating system exists/is designed boolean variable equal to true: `heating_system_exists_is-designed_u = TRUE`

    - # Determine if the same zone has been analyzed with a HVAC system in P-RMR
    - Get the analogous Zone ID in the P_RMR: `zone_p = match_data_element(P_RMR,Zones,zone_u.id)` 
        - Check if there are terminal units associated with the zone, if not skip to if statements based on if there are heating and cooling systems: `if len(zone_p.terminals) != 0:`
