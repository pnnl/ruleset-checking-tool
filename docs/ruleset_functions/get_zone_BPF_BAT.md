# get_zone_BPF_BAT
**Schema Version:** 0.0.29

**Description:** Get a dictionary of the BPF_BAT and areas for a given zone.
- The function looks at the space lighting type to guess a building area type for a BuildingSegment whose bpf_building_area_type has not been specified AND lighting_building_area_type is NONE

**Inputs:**  
- **B-RMD**: The baseline ruleset model instance
- **zone_id**: the id of the zone

**Returns:**  
- **zone_BPF_BAT_dict**: A dict for the zone that saves the BPF_BAT as keys and the areas as the values. Example: {SCHOOL: 50000, UNDETERMINED: 2000}
 
**Function Call:** 
- None

## Logic:  

- create a dictionary to map lighting space types to BPF building area types: ```building_area_lookup = {

- create dictionary to store the sum of space area assigned to each mapped BPF building area type `zone_BPF_BAT_dict`: `zone_BPF_BAT_dict = {}`
- get the zone using the function get_object_by_id: `get_object_by_id(B_RMD, zone_id)`
- iterate through each space in the zone: `for space in zone.spaces:`
  - map from the lighting space type to the BPF building area type: `space_BPF_BAT = building_area_lookup[space.lighting_space_type]`
  - add this space type to the zone_BPF_BAT_dict if it doesn't exist yet: `if space_BPF_BAT not in zone_BPF_BAT_dict: zone_BPF_BAT_dict[space_BPF_BAT] = space.floor_area`
  - otherwise just add the space area: `zone_BPF_BAT_dict[space_BPF_BAT] += space.floor_area`

       **Returns** `return zone_BPF_BAT_dict`  

**Notes/Questions:** 
1. at the time of writing this RDS, bpf_building_area_type is not yet a part of the schema.
2. Check Mapping Scheme:
   - Scheme Overview:
   - UNDETERMINED = Space type could exist in more than one of the BPF Building Area Types. Lean towards UNDETERMINED in uncertainty because misinterpretation by this function could cause false FAIL outcomes
   - [MULTIFAMILY, HEALTHCARE_HOSPITAL, OFFICE, RESTAURANT, RETAIL, SCHOOL, WAREHOUSE] = Space type is most likely to exist in one of these building area types
   - ALL_OTHER = Space type is not likely to exist in any of [MULTIFAMILY, HEALTHCARE_HOSPITAL, OFFICE, RESTAURANT, RETAIL, SCHOOL, WAREHOUSE] building area types
