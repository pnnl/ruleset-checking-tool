# HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment - Rule 18-29
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  

**Rule ID:** 18-29
**Rule Description:** If the baseline HVAC system type is 9 or 10, additional system types shall be used for all HVAC zones that are mechanically cooled in the proposed design. The baseline HVAC system types for such zones shall be determined based on the building area type determined in accordance with G3.1.1.1(a) and the requirements of G3.1.1.1(c).
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 18 HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1.1.e

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Baseline System type is 9 or 10
2. zone is mechanically cooled in the proposed model

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate whether each Zone is served by the correct HVAC system type
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zone_target_baseline_system()
2. section_18_rule_test()


**Applicability Checks:**

## Rule Logic:  
- The target string is: `target_string = "G3_1_1e"
- get the list of zones, their expected systems and the source string: `zones_expected_system_types = get_zone_target_baseline_system(P-RMD,B-RMD)`

- loop through the zones: `for zone in zones_expected_system_types:`
	- use the section_18_rule_test function to determine whether the zone meets the requirements: `zone_result = section_18_rule_test(P-RMD,B-RMD,zone.id,target_string,zones_expected_system_types[zone]["EXPECTED_SYSTEM_TYPE"])`


  **Rule Assertion - Zone:**

 - Case 1: the target strings don't match, so it is not applicable to this zone: `if zone_result == NOT_APPLICABLE: NOT_APPLICABLE`
 - Case 2: All terminals in the zone are the expected system type (there should only be one terminal in the zone, but this rule doesn't check number of terminals):`if zone_result == PASS: PASS`

 - Case 3: Else: `else: FAIL`
