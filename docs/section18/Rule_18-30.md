# HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment - Rule 18-30
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  

**Rule ID:** 18-30
**Rule Description:** If the baseline HVAC system serves HVAC zones that includes computer rooms, baseline system 11 shall be used where the baseline HVAC system type is 7 or 8 and the total computer room peak cooling load is greater than 600,000 BTU/h (175 kW) AND <= 3,000,000
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 18 HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1.1.g

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. The applicable zone is a computer room zone
2. Building has peak computer room load > 600,000 btu/hr and <=3,000,000 btu/hr
3. Baseline system type is Sys-7 or Sys-8

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate whether each Zone is served by the correct HVAC system type
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zone_target_baseline_system()
2. section_18_rule_test()


**Applicability Checks:**

## Rule Logic:  
- The target string is: `target_string = "G3_1_1g_part1"
- get the list of zones, their expected systems and the source string: `zones_expected_system_types = get_zone_target_baseline_system(P-RMD,B-RMD)`

- loop through the zones: `for zone in zones_expected_system_types:`
	- use the section_18_rule_test function to determine whether the zone meets the requirements: `zone_result = section_18_rule_test(P-RMD,B-RMD,zone.id,target_string,zones_expected_system_types[zone]["EXPECTED_SYSTEM_TYPE"])`


  **Rule Assertion - Zone:**

 - Case 1: the target strings don't match, so it is not applicable to this zone: `if zone_result == NOT_APPLICABLE: NOT_APPLICABLE`
 - Case 2: All terminals in the zone are the expected system type (there should only be one terminal in the zone, but this rule doesn't check number of terminals):`if zone_result == PASS: PASS`

 - Case 3: Else: `else: FAIL`
