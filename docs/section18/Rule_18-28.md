# HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment - Rule 18-28
**Schema Version:** 0.0.22  

**Rule ID:** 18-28
**Rule Description:** HVAC zones designed with heating-only systems in the proposed design serving storage rooms, stairwells, vestibules, electrical/mechanical rooms, and restrooms not exhausting or transferring air from mechanically cooled thermal zones in the proposed design shall use system type 9 or 10 in the baseline building design.

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 18 HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1.1.e

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. zone is heating-only in the proposed design
2. zone space type is one of the following: vestibule, storage room, stairwell, electrical/ mechanical room, restroom
3. the zone in the proposed design does not exhaust or transfer air from an air conditioned zone

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate whether each Zone is served by the correct HVAC system type
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zone_target_baseline_system()
2. section_18_rule_test()
3. is_zone_a_vestibule


**Applicability Checks:**

## Rule Logic:  
- The target string is: `target_string = "G3_1_1e"
- get the list of zones, their expected systems and the source string: `zones_expected_system_types = get_zone_target_baseline_system(P-RMD,B-RMD)`

- loop through the zones: `for zone in zones_expected_system_types:`
  - is_a_vestibule = is_zone_a_vestibule(zone, B-RMI)
	- use the section_18_rule_test function to determine whether the zone meets the requirements: `zone_result = section_18_rule_test(P-RMD,B-RMD,zone.id,target_string,zones_expected_system_types[zone]["EXPECTED_SYSTEM_TYPE"])`


  **Rule Assertion - Zone:**

 - Case 1: the zone is NOT a vestibule and the target strings don't match, so it is not applicable to this zone: `if is_a_vestibule == NO and zone_result == NOT_APPLICABLE: NOT_APPLICABLE`
 - Case 2: the zone is NOT a vestibule and All terminals in the zone are the expected system type (there should only be one terminal in the zone, but this rule doesn't check number of terminals):`if is_a_vestibule == NO and zone_result == PASS: PASS`
 - Case 3: the zone might be a vestibule and the target strings don't match, return undetermined with the text "Zone #{zone.id} has been identified as a likely vestibule.  If this zone is a vestibule, it should be provided with heating-only system 9 or 10 in the baseline model.": `if is_a_vestibule == MAYBE and zone_result == NOT_APPLICABLE: UNDETERMINED`
 - Case 4: the zone is maybe a vestibule and the target strings match, return undetermined with the text "Zone #{zone.id} has been identified as a likely vestibule.  If manual review confirms that this is a vestibule, the zone passes.": `if is_a_vestibule == MAYBE and zone_result == PASS: UNDETERMINED`
