# HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment â€“ Rule 18-23  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.28
**Mandatory Rule:** True    
**Rule ID:** 18-23  
 
**Rule Description:** The lab exhaust fan shall be modeled as constant horsepower (kilowatts) reflecting constant-volume stack discharge with outdoor air bypass in the baseline

**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each Building   

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. The building includes >15,000cfm of lab exhaust

**Function Call:** 

1. get_building_lab_zones()
2. get_building_total_lab_exhaust_from_zone_exhaust_fan()
3. get_zone_target_baseline_system()



**Applicability Check:** 
- the rule is applicable if the building has total lab exhaust greater than 15,000 cfm.  The only way we know for sure is if there is greater than 15,000 cfm of lab exhaust from zone exhaust fans in the building. Use the function `get_building_total_lab_exhaust_from_zone_exhaust_fan` to determine whether there is definitely 15,000 cfm of lab exhaust in the building: `if get_building_total_lab_exhaust_from_zone_exhaust_fan(P_RMI): CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
- otherwise, check if any of the target baseline system types from the function `get_zone_target_baseline_system` have a SYSTEM_ORIGIN of "G3_1_1d" - this indicates that there is greater than 15,000 cfm of laboratory exhaust in the building, and that some of it comes from air handlers: `else:`
   - get the target baseline systems: `target_baseline_systems = get_zone_target_baseline_system(P_RMI,B_RMI)`
   - look through all of the target baseline systems, and determine if any has a SYSTEM_ORIGIN of "G3_1_1d": `if any(zone["SYSTEM_ORIGIN"] == "G3_1_1d" for zone in target_baseline_systems):`
      - in this case, the building might have greater than 15,000cfm lab exhaust, but it's not sure.  Set the result to UNDETERMINED to trigger a manual review: `result = UNDETERMINED`
        
**Rule Logic:**
- if we arrived here, there is greater than 15,000cfm of lab exhaust in the P_RMI.  In order for this rule to pass, we need to meet the following conditions:
  1. all of the lab zones need to be on the same baseline system
  2. 


**Rule Assertion:**
