# Airside systems – Rule 4-10

**Schema Version:** 0.0.23
**Rule ID:** 4-10  
 
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours excluding HVAC systems that meet Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building exceptions #s 2 and 3.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMD = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exceptions #s 2 and 3  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Not applicable to HVAC systems in which there are health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours or to HVAC systems primarily serving computer rooms.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms()
2. get_hvac_systems_serving_zone_health_safety_vent_reqs()
3. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()  

**Manual Check:** None 

**Rule Logic**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of hvac systems that primarily serve computer rooms: `hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms (P_RMD)`
- Get list of hvac system that are likely to serves zones that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `hvac_health_safety_unocc_list_p = get_hvac_systems_serving_zone_health_safety_vent_reqs(P_RMD)`
- Create list of inappliable hvac systems: `inapplicable_hvac_sys_list_p = hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p + hvac_health_safety_unocc_list_p`           
- For each hvac_p in P-RMD: `for each hvac_p in P_RMD...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`                         
    - Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check (not in the list of inapplicable systems): `if hvac_p not in inapplicable_hvac_sys_list_p:`
        - Get hvac fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied`  
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling in the P_RMD: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`
        - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system: `Else: FAIL`
