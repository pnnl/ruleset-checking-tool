# Airside System - Rule 4-14  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.13  
**Mandatory Rule:** True   
**Rule ID:** 4-14  
**Rule Description:** A computer room is defined as a room whose primary function is to house equipment for the processing and storage of electronic data and that has a design electronic data equipment power density exceeding 20 W/ft2 of conditioned floor area.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = Expected value   
**Appendix G Section:** Section 3 Definitions      
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section 3 Definitions  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each Space Data Group

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to spaces with the space.lighting_space_type equal to "COMPUTER_ROOM".

**Function Calls:**  None  

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each space in the P_RMR: `For space_p in P_RMR...Space:`
    - Check if the lighting space type classification equals computer room: `if space_p.lighting_space_type == "COMPUTER_ROOM":`
        - For each hour of the year: `For x in Range(8760):`
            - Reset the aggregated_schedule_times_Wattage values: `aggregated_schedule_times_Wattage = 0`
            - For each miscellaneous equipment id in the space: `For misc_p in space_p.miscellaneous_equipment:`
                - Get the miscellaneous equipment Wattage: `misc_p_power = misc_p.power`
                - Get the miscellaneous equipment schedule hourly value (convert the schedule to an 8760 schedule using a function if needed): `misc_p_hourly_schedule_value = misc_p.multiplier_schedule.hourly_values(x)`
                - Calculate Wattage * schedule value for this hour for this misc_p: `misc_p_schedule_times_Wattage = misc_p_misc_power * misc_p_hourly_schedule_value`
                - Adding to running total of Wattage associated with the space for the hour: `aggregated_schedule_times_Wattage = aggregated_schedule_times_Wattage + misc_p_schedule_times_Wattage`
            - Add aggregated Wattage value to the new 8760 aggregated Wattage schedule for this specific hour: `aggregated_space_Wattage_schedule[x] = aggregated_schedule_times_Wattage`
        - Find the maximum Wattage in the aggregated space Wattage schedule: `Wattage_Max = Max(aggregated_space_Wattage_schedule)`
        - Get the square footage of the space: `floor_area = space_p.floor_area * CONVERSION(M2 to FT2)`
        - Calculate the maximum equipment power density for the space (max Wattage/space sf): `space_EPD = Wattage_Max/floor_area`
        
    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - Case 1: For each applicable space, if the IT equipment power density is greater than 20 then pass: `if space_EPD >20: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 2: Else, For applicable each zone: `Else: outcome == "FAIL" and raise_message "THE SPACE HAS BEEN CLASSED AS A COMPUTER ROOM IN TERMS OF THE LIGHTING SPACE TYPE BUT THE ELECTRONIC DATA EQUIPMENT POWER DENSITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO EXCEED 20 W/SF."`
