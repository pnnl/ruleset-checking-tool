# Airside System - Rule 4-14  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.13  
**Mandatory Rule:** True   
**Rule ID:** 4-14  
**Rule Description:** A computer room is defined as a room whose primary function is to house equipment for the processing and storage of electronic data and that has a design electronic data equipment power density exceeding 20 W/ft2 of conditioned floor area.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMD = Expected value   
**Appendix G Section:** Section 3 Definitions      
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section 3 Definitions  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each Space Data Group

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to spaces with the space.lighting_space_type equal to "COMPUTER_ROOM".

**Function Calls:**  None  

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each space in the P_RMD: `For space_p in P_RMD...Space:`
    - Check if the lighting space type classification equals computer room: `if space_p.lighting_space_type == "COMPUTER_ROOM":`
        - Reset the total_space_misc_Wattage_including_multiplier_p variable: `total_space_misc_Wattage_including_multiplier_p = 0`
        - For each miscellaneous equipment id in the space: `For misc_p in space_p.miscellaneous_equipment:`
            - Check if the energy type is electricity, if not then skip this misc_p: `if misc_p.energy_type = "ELECTRICITY":`
                - Get the miscellaneous equipment Wattage: `misc_power_p = misc_p.power`
                - Get the maximum of (1.0 and the maximum value in the miscellaneous equipment multiplier schedule) (convert the schedule to an 8760 schedule using a function if needed): `misc_multiplier_value_p = min(1,max(misc_p.multiplier_schedule.hourly_values))`
                - Calculate (misc_power_p * misc_multiplier_value_p) for this misc_p: `misc_total_Wattage_p = misc_power_p * misc_multiplier_value_p`
                - Add to the running total of Wattage associated with the space: `total_space_misc_Wattage_including_multiplier_p = total_space_misc_Wattage_including_multiplier_p + misc_total_Wattage_p`
        - Get the square footage of the space: `floor_area_p = space_p.floor_area`
        - Calculate the maximum equipment power density for the space (total design Wattage/space sf): `EPD_p = total_space_misc_Wattage_including_multiplier_p/floor_area_p`
        
        **Rule Assertion:**  
        - Case 1: For each applicable space, if the equipment power density is greater than 20 then pass: `if EPD_p >20: outcome == "PASS"`
        - Case 2: Else, For applicable each zone: `Else: outcome == "FAIL" and raise_message "THE SPACE HAS BEEN CLASSED AS A COMPUTER ROOM IN TERMS OF THE LIGHTING SPACE TYPE BUT THE ELECTRONIC DATA EQUIPMENT POWER DENSITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO EXCEED 20 W/SF."`
