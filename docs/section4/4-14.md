# Airside System - Rule 4-14  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.13  
**Mandatory Rule:** True   
**Rule ID:** 4-14  
**Rule Description:** A computer room is defined as a room whose primary function is to house equipment for the processing and storage of electronic data and that has a design electronic data equipment power density exceeding 20 W/ft2 of conditioned floor area.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = Expected value   
**Appendix G Section:** Section 3 Definitions      
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section 3 Definitions  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each Space Data Group

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Applicable to spaces with the space.lighting_space_type equal to "COMPUTER_ROOM".

**Function Calls:**  None  


## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each space in the P_RMR: `For space_p in P_RMR...Space:`
    - Check if the lighting space type classification equals computer room: `if space_p.lighting_space_type == "COMPUTER_ROOM":`
        - Reset the total space wattage variable to zero: `total_space_wattage = 0`
        - For each miscellaneous equipment id in the space: `For misc_p in space_p.miscellaneous_equipment:`
            - Check if it is IT equipment: `if misc_p.miscellaneous_equipment_type == "INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY_EQUIPMENT":`
                - Add Wattage to the total space Wattage: `total_space_wattage = total_space_wattage + misc_p.power`
        - Get the square footage of the space: `floor_area = space_p.floor_area * CONVERSION(M2 to FT2)`
        - Calculate the total IT equipment power density for the space: `space_EPD = total_space_Wattage/floor_area`
        
    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - Case 1: For each applicable space, if the IT equipment power density is greater than 20 then pass: `if space_EPD >20: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 2: Else, For applicable each zone: `Else: outcome == "FAIL" and raise_message "THE SPACE HAS BEEN CLASSED AS A COMPUTER ROOM IN TERMS OF THE LIGHTING SPACE TYPE BUT THE ELECTRONIC DATA EQUIPMENT POWER DENSITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO EXCEED 20 W/SF."`
