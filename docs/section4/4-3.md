# Airside System – Rule 4-3

**Schema Version:** 0.0.23
**Rule ID:** 4-3
 
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMD = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:**  Section G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exception #1.   
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  None
**Data Lookup:** None 
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. This rule does not apply when no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating()
2. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling()

**Manual Check:** None  

**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Call function to get list of inapplicable HVAC systems due to virtual cooling being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 d : `inapplicable_HVAC_systems_cooling_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling(U_RMD,P_RMD)`
- Call function to get list of inapplicable HVAC systems due to virtual heating being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 c:`inapplicable_HVAC_systems_heating_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating(U_RMD,P_RMD)`
There may be duplicates in the following list of inapplicable hvac systems but it is not impactful
- Combine list of inapplicable hvac systems: `inapplicable_HVAC_systems_list_p = inapplicable_HVAC_systems_cooling_list_p + inapplicable_HVAC_systems_heating_list_p`
- For each HeatingVentilationAirconditioningSystem in the P_RMD check if this check is applicable: `for each hvac_p in P_RMD..HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Check if hvac_p is not in the list of inapplicable systems, if it is not found then set applicability flag to true: `if hvac_p not in inapplicable_HVAC_systems_list_p: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`   
    - If rule_applicability_flag = TRUE for hvac_p: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
        - Get fan operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operation_during_occupied` 
        - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].minimum_outdoor_airflow`

        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during occupied periods is continuous and the minimum OA is greater than 0 in the P_RMD: `if operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p >0 : PASS`
        - Case 2: else if, fan system operation during occupied periods is cycling and the minimum OA equals 0 in the P_RMD: `else if operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 : PASS`
        - Case 3: Else: `Else: FAIL`
