# Airside Systems – Rule 4-6

**Rule ID:** 4-6
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans in the proposed design model shall remain on during unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #3 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem 
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to hvac systems primarily serving computer rooms.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms()

**Manual Check:** None  
 
**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of hvac systems that primary serve computer rooms: `hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms (P_RMR)`
- For each hvac_p in hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p: `for hvac_p in hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_p:`
    - Get operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied`  
    - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR and OA CFM >0: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS” AND minimum_outdoor_airflow_p > 0: PASS`
    - Case 2: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is intermittent in the P_RMR and OA CFM =0: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING” AND minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = 0: PASS`
    - Case 3: Else, for each applicable hvac system system: `Else: FAIL`
