# Airside System - Rule 4-19    
**Schema Version:** 0.0.13  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-19    
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans in the baseline design model that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours excluding HVAC systems that meet Table G3.1-4 Schedules per the proposed column exceptions #s 2 and 3.  

#2 HVAC fans shall remain on during occupied and unoccupied hours in spaces that have health- and safety mandated
minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.  
#3 HVAC fans shall remain on during occupied and unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  


**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1-4 Schedules proposed building column excluding exceptions #s 2 and 3  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem data table  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Not applicable to HVAC systems in which there are health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours or to HVAC systems primarily serving computer rooms.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms()
2. get_hvac_systems_serving_zone_health_safety_vent_reqs()
3. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()  

**Manual Check:** None 

**Rule Logic**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of hvac systems that primarily serve computer rooms: `hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_b = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms (B_RMR)`
- Get list of hvac system that are likely to serves zones that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `hvac_health_safety_unocc_list_b = get_hvac_systems_serving_zone_health_safety_vent_reqs(B_RMR)`
- Create list of inappliable hvac systems: `inapplicable_hvac_sys_list_b = hvac_systems_brimarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_b + hvac_health_safety_unocc_list_b`           
- For each hvac_b in B-RMR: `for each hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`                         
    - Check if the hvac system is applicable to this check (not in the list of inapplicable systems): `if hvac_b not in inapplicable_hvac_sys_list_b:`
        - Get hvac fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied`  
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling in the B_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_b == “CYCLING”: PASS`
        - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system: `Else: FAIL`
