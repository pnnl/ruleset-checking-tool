# Airside System - Rule 4-8  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-8  
 
**Rule Description:** Schedules may be allowed to differ between proposed design and baseline building design when necessary to model nonstandard efficiency measures, such as automatic natural ventilation controls, automatic demand control ventilation controls. In no case shall schedules differ where the controls are manual.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR                                             
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 4 Baseline Exception 2  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  None

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to zones with nonstandard efficiency measures, such as automatic natural ventilation controls, automatic demand control ventilation controls.

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each Zone data group  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. match_data_element()  
2. get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone()

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...Zone:`
    - Reset zone has DCV in proposed boolean variable to FALSE: `zone_has_DCV_p = FALSE`
    - Reset zone has DCV in baseline boolean variable to FALSE: `zone_has_DCV_b = FALSE`
    - Reset schedule mismatch boolean variable to FALSE: `min_OA_sch_mismatch = FALSE`
    - Get analogous zone in the B_RMR and store as an object: `zone_b = match_data_element(B_RMR,Zone,zone_p.id)`
    - Get whether any of the terminal units have DCV in the proposed: `for terminal_p in Zone_p.Terminals:`
        - Check if the terminal unit has DCV, if it does set DCV boolean variable to true: `if terminal_p.has_demand_control_ventilation = TRUE: zone_has_DCV_p = TRUE`
    - Get whether any of the terminal units have DCV in the baseline: `for terminal_b in Zone_b.Terminals:`
        - Check if the terminal unit has DCV, if it does set DCV boolean variable to true: `if terminal_b.has_demand_control_ventilation = TRUE: zone_has_DCV_b = TRUE`
    - Get aggregated hourly minimum OA CFM schedule for the proposed: `min_OA_CFM_sch_zone_p = get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone(P_RMR,zone_p.id)`
    - Get aggregated hourly minimum OA CFM schedule for the baseline: `min_OA_CFM_sch_zone_b = get_min_OA_CFM_sch_zone(B_RMR,zone_b.id)`
    - Check if there are schedule mismatches between the baseline and proposed hourly minimum OA CFM schedules (assumes 8760 schedule for the minimum_outdoor_airflow_multiplier_schedule, is that reasonable?): `For i in Range(8760):`
        - Check if baseline and proposed are NOT equal for the hour, if there is a mismatch set the mismatch boolean variable to TRUE: `if min_OA_CFM_sch_zone_p(i) != min_OA_CFM_sch_zone_b(i): min_OA_sch_mismatch = TRUE`  
    **Rule Assertion:**                
    - Case 1: if DCV boolean variables are equal for the baseline and proposed but there is a schedule mismatch then FAIL: `if zone_has_DCV_p == zone_has_DCV_b AND min_OA_sch_mismatch == TRUE: outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "THERE IS A MINIMUM OA CFM SCHEDULE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE BASELINE AND PROPOSED RMRs FOR THIS ZONE. FAIL UNLESS TABLE G3.1 #4 BASELINE COLUMN EXCEPTION #2 IS APPLICABLE"`
    - Case 2: Else then pass: `Else: outcome == "Pass"`
