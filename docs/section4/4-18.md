# Airside System - Rule 4-18    
**Schema Version:** 0.0.13  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-18    
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans in the baseline design model shall remain on during unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms in the B_RMD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMD = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #3 in the proposed column  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem 
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to hvac systems primarily serving computer rooms.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms()

**Manual Check:** None  
 
**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of hvac systems that primary serve computer rooms: `hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_b = get_HVAC_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms (B_RMD)`
- For each hvac_b in hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_b: `for hvac_b in hvac_systems_primarily_serving_comp_rooms_list_b:`
    - Get operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied`  
    - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0].minimum_outdoor_airflow`  
    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the B_RMD and min OA CFM is greater than 0 then pass: `if operation_during_unoccupied_b == “CONTINUOUS” AND minimum_outdoor_airflow_b > 0: PASS`
    - Case 2: For each applicable hvac system, else if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling in the B_RMD and min OA CFM = 0 then pass: `elif operation_during_unoccupied_b == “CYCLING” AND minimum_outdoor_airflow_b == 0: PASS`
    - Case 3: Else, for each applicable hvac system system: `Else: FAIL" `
