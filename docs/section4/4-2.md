# Airside System - Rule 4-2
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-2  
**Rule Description:** Humidity Control Setpoints shall be the same for proposed design and baseline building design.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR   
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 4 proposed and baseline columns including exception #1 and #2.      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  


**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each Zone Data Group

**Applicability Checks:** None

**Function Calls:**  
1. match_data_element()


## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each zone in the B_RMR: `for zone_b in B_RMR...Zone:`
    - Schedule mismatch boolean variable: `schedule_mismatch = FALSE`
    - Get baseline minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: `minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b = zone_b.minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule`
    - Get analogous proposed minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: `minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p = match_data_element(P_RMR,Zone,zone_b.id.id).minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule`
    
    - if a humidity schedule is not defined for either the baseline or proposed skip to the rule assertion (in other words continue with the rule logic if humidity schedules are defined in both the baseline and proposed RMRs): `if minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null:`
        - Loop through each hour of the schedules and compare across the B_RMR and P_RMR, : `for x in len(minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b.hourly_values):`
            - Check if schedules match each hour of the year, if there is a mismatch then set the schedule_mismatch boolean variable equal to TRUE: `if minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b.hourly_values(x) != minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p.hourly_values(x):schedule_mismatch = TRUE`    
        - Check if a schedule mismatch was identified if it was then skip indented and go to rule assertion: `if schedule_mismatch == FALSE:`
            - Get baseline maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: `maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b = zone_b.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule`
            - Get analogous proposed maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: `maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p = match_data_element(P_RMR,Zone,zone_b.id.id).maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule`
            - if a humidity schedule is not defined for either the baseline or proposed skip to the rule assertion (in other words continue with the rule logic if humidity schedules are defined in both the baseline and proposed RMRs): `if maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null:`
                - Loop through each hour of the schedules and compare across the B_RMR and P_RMR, : `for x in len(maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b.hourly_values):`
                    - Check if schedules match each hour of the year, if there is a mismatch then set the schedule_mismatch boolean variable equal to TRUE: `if maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b.hourly_values(x) != maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p.hourly_values(x):schedule_mismatch = TRUE`   
        
    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - Case 1: For each zone, if both humidity schedules for the baseline and proposed are undefined then pass: `if minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null and maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 2: For each zone, else if the baseline humidity schedule is defined and the proposed humidity schedule is undefined then fail: `elif (minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null) OR (maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null) : outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "Fail because a humidity schedule is defined in the B_RMR but not in the P_RMR."`
    - Case 3: For each zone, else if the baseline humidity schedule is undefined and the proposed humidity schedule is defined then fail: `elif (minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null) OR (maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null): outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "Fail because a humidity schedule is undefined in the B_RMR but is defined in the P_RMR."`
    - Case 4: For each zone, else if the baseline and proposed humidity schedules match: `elif schedule_mismatch == FALSE: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 5: Else, For each zone, humidity schedules do not match: `Else: outcome == "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "THERE IS A HUMIDITY SCHEDULE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE BASELINE AND PROPOSED RMRs. FAIL UNLESS TABLE G3.1 #4 BASELINE COLUMN EXCEPTION #s 1 and/or 2 ARE APPLICABLE"`  

**Future Change Note:**

  1. zone.minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule and zone.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule need to be approved by the schema working group.
