# Airside System - Rule 4-15  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.23  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-15  
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied in the B_RMD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMD = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:**  Section G3.1-4 Schedules excluding exception #1.   
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  None
**Data Lookup:** None 
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem data group    

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. This rule does not apply when no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating()
2. get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling()
3. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area()  
4. match_data_element()  
5. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()

**Manual Check:** None  

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**   
- Call function to get list of proposed HVAC systems in which virtual cooling being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 d : `HVAC_systems_virtual_cooling_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling(U_RMD,P_RMD)`
- Call function to get list of proposed HVAC systems in which virtual heating being modeled in the proposed per G3.1-10 c:`HVAC_systems_virtual_heating_list_p = get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_heating(U_RMD,P_RMD)`
- Combine list of hvac systems with virtual heating and/or cooling: `HVAC_systems_virtual_list_p = HVAC_systems_virtual_cooling_list_p + HVAC_systems_virtual_heating_list_p`
- Eliminate duplicate HVAC systems: `HVAC_systems_virtual_list_p = list(set(HVAC_systems_virtual_list_p))`  
Create a list of the zones served by the HVAC systems in which virtual heating and/or cooling has been modeled in the proposed RMD
- Get dictionary with list of zones associated with each HVAC system: `dict_hvac_sys_zones_served_p = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area(P_RMD)`
- Loop through the HVAC systems with virtual heating and/or cooling and add to list of zones with virtual heating and/or cooling: `For hvac_p in HVAC_systems_virtual_list_p:`
    - Get list of zones associated with the hvac system and add to list of zones with virtual heating and/or cooling: `zones_virtual_heating_cooling_list = zones_virtual_heating_cooling_list.append(list(dict_hvac_sys_zones_served_p[hvac_p.id]["Zone_List"].values()))`
- Eliminate duplicate zones from the list: `zones_virtual_heating_cooling_list = list(set(zones_virtual_heating_cooling_list))`
- Loop through each zone in the zones_virtual_heating_cooling_list and obtain the hvac system serving the zone in the B_RMD and add to the list of HVAC systems inapplicable to this check: `For zone_p in zones_virtual_heating_cooling_list:`
    - Get analogous zone in the B_RMD: `zone_b = match_data_element(B_RMD, Zone,zone_p.id)`  
    - Get list of hvac systems serving the zone and add to list of inapplicable hvac systems: `inapplicable_hvac_with_virtual_heating_cooling = inapplicable_hvac_with_virtual_heating_cooling.append(get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(B_RMD, zone_b.id))`  
- Eliminate duplicates in list of hvac systems: `inapplicable_hvac_with_virtual_heating_cooling = list(set(inapplicable_hvac_with_virtual_heating_cooling))`
- For each HeatingVentilationAirconditioningSystem in the B_RMD check if this check is applicable: `for each hvac_b in B_RMD..HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Check if hvac_b is not in the list of inapplicable systems, if it is not found then set applicability flag to true: `if hvac_b not in inapplicable_hvac_with_virtual_heating_cooling: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`   
    - If rule_applicability_flag = TRUE for hvac_b: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
        - Get fan operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0].operation_during_occupied` 
        - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0].minimum_outdoor_airflow`

        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during occupied periods is continuous and the minimum OA is greater than 0 in the B_RMD: `if operation_during_occupied_b == “CONTINUOUS” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p >0 : PASS`
        - Case 2: else if, fan system operation during occupied periods is cycling and the minimum OA equals 0 in the B_RMD: `else if operation_during_occupied_b == “CYCLING” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 : PASS`
        - Case 3: Else: `Else: FAIL`
