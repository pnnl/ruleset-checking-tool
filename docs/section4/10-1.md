# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-1

**Rule ID:** 10-1
 
**Rule Description:** The proposed design includes humidification (which does not comply with 90.1-2019 Section 6.5.2.4) and the baseline building design has been modeled with adiabatic humidification, as expected.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. The zone in the P-RMR includes humidification.

**Function Call:** 

1. match_data_element()

**Manual Check:** Check that the applicable baseline HVAC systems were modeled per the rules of G3.1-10 HVAC System baseline column which states that if the proposed design includes humidification then the baseline building design shall use adiabatic humidification. Exception: If the proposed building humidification system complies with Section 6.5.2.4 then the baseline building design shall use nonadiabatic humidification.


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Call function to get list of applicable zones in P_RMR: `applicable_zones_hvac_sys_humid_dict_p = get_zones_hvac_sys_humid_p(P_RMR)`
- For each zone in P_RMR: `zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - Check if the zone has humidification in the P_RMR: `if applicable_zones_hvac_sys_humid_dict_p.has_key(zone_p.id):
- Get analogous zone ID in the B_RMR: `zone_b = match_data_element(B_RMR,Zones,zone_p.id)`
    - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for one terminal unit (should be the same for each terminal in the baseline): `served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_b = zone_b.terminals[0].served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
