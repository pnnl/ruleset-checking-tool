# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-1

**Rule ID:** 10-1
 
**Rule Description:** The proposed design includes humidification (which does not comply with 90.1-2019 Section 6.5.2.4) and the baseline building design has been modeled with adiabatic humidification, as expected.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems for the baseline building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR and P_RMR
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. The P-RMR includes humidification.
2. PLACEHOLDER, baseline HVAC system types have been established correctly.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**
