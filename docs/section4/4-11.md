# Airside System - Rule 4-11  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-11    
 
**Rule Description:** Fan Schedules may be allowed to differ when Section G3.1.1(c) applies, i.e. baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones) served by the system or when the total peak internal gains that differ by 10 Btu/h·ft2 or more from the average of other HVAC zones served by the system.  

**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 4 Baseline Exception 3  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem   

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies when baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones) served by the system or when the total peak internal gains that differ by 10 Btu/h·ft2 or more from the average of other HVAC zones served by the system.    

**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs()  
2. get_hvac_system_with_longest_fan_schedule_p()  
3. match_data_element()  

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- For each zone in the P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...Zone:`
    - Reset schedule mismatch variable, used to track if the schedules mismatch: `schedule_mismatch = FALSE`
    - Get hvac system with the longest fan operating schedule in the proposed to compare to baseline: `hvac_p = get_hvac_system_with_longest_fan_schedule_p(zone_p.id, P_RMR)`
    - Get fan schedule associated wwith the longest fan operating schedule to compare to baseline: `fan_schedule_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operating_schedule.hourly_values`
    - Get baseline hvac system serving the zone, assumes one hvac system per zone which is consistent with the requirements of App G: `hvac_b = match_data_element(B_RMR,Zone,zone_p.id).terminals[0].served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_system` 
    - Get fan schedule associated with the baseline system: `fan_schedule_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0].operating_schedule.hourly_values` 
        - Check if schedules matches for each hour of the year, if there is a mismatch then set the schedule_mismatch boolean variable equal to TRUE: `if fan_schedule_b.hourly_values(x) != fan_schedule_p.hourly_values(x):schedule_mismatch = TRUE`
