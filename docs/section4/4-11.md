# Airside systems â€“ Rule 4-11

**Rule ID:** 4-11
 
**Rule Description:** Fan Schedules may be allowed to differ when Section G3.1.1(c) applies, i.e. baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones) served by the system.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 4 Baseline Exception 3
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies when baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones) served by the system.  

**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs()
2. match_data_element()

**Manual Check:** Check that fan schedules have been modeled appropriately in the baseline and proposed when fan schedules are allowed to differ between the baseline and proposed per Appendix G Section G3.1.1(c).

**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get dict of zone id keys and hvac id values applicable to this check: `section_G3.1.1c_applies_zones_hvac_dict_b = get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs(B_RMR)`
- Create list of baseline hvac systems in which Appendix G Section G3.1.1(c) applies: `hvac_systems_section_G3.1.1c_applies_list_b = list(section_G3.1.1c_applies_zones_hvac_dict_b.values())`
- For each hvac_b in the list in which Section G3.1.1c applies: `for hvac_b in hvac_systems_section_G3.1.1c_applies_list_b:`   
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is undetermined: `UNDETERMINED`
    - Case 2: Else, for each non applicable zone:`Else: IN_APPLICABLE`
