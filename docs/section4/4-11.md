# ASHVAC â€“ Rule 4-11

**Rule ID:** 4-11
 
**Rule Description:** Fan Schedules may be allowed to differ when Section G3.1.1(c) applies, i.e. baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones???) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones???) served by the system.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 4 Baseline Exception 3
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each zone 
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs()


**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  

**Applicability Checks:** 
- Get list of zones applicable to this check: `applicable_zones_list_b = get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs(B_RMR)`
- For each zone_b in the B_RMR: `for zone_b in ... B_RMR:`
    - Check if zone_b in an applicable zone: `if zone_b.id in applicable_zones_list_b:`


## Rule Logic:

                                          
                                     
                    **Rule Assertion - Component:**
                    - Case 1: For each applicable fan system, undetermined, save hvac id to output array for applicable components: `if rule_applicability_check == TRUE: UNDETERMINED and applicable_component_array.append(zone_info_list_b[0])`

                    - Case 2: Else, for each non applicable fan system, save hvac id to output array for non applicable components:`Else: NOT APPLICABLE and not_applicable_component_array.append(zone_info_list_b[0])`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If there are no fan systems with UNDETERMINED outcome: `if len(applicable_component_array) == 0: NOT APPLICABLE`

- Case 2 : Else: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message ${not_applicable_component_array}`
 

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. B-RMR modeled with baseline HVAC system types 3 or 4 to to comply with Section G3.1.1 c. 
2. B-RMR modeled baseline HVAC systems were established correctly: `if Rule 18-1a == PASS`
