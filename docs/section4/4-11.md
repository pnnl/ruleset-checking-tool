# Airside systems â€“ Rule 4-11

**Rule ID:** 4-11
 
**Rule Description:** Fan Schedules may be allowed to differ when Section G3.1.1(c) applies, i.e. baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones) served by the system.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = B-RMR                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 4 Baseline Exception 3
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies when baseline HVAC system type 3 or 4 has been used for spaces (zones) that differ by more than 40 equivalent full load hrs/week from other spaces (zones) served by the system.  

**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs()

**Manual Check:** Check that fan schedules have been modeled appropriately in the baseline and proposed when fan schedules are allowed to differ between the baseline and proposed per Appendix G Section G3.1.1(c).

**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get dict of zone id keys and hvac id values applicable to this check: `applicable_zones_dict_b = get_zones_G3.1.1c_40_EFLHs(B_RMR)`
- For each zone_b in the B_RMR: `for zone_b in ... B_RMR:`
    - Check if zone_b is an applicable zone: `if zone_b.id in applicable_zones_dict_b:`
        **Rule Assertion:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable zone, outcome is undetermined: `UNDETERMINED`
        - Case 2: Else, for each non applicable zone:`Else: IN_APPLICABLE`
