# ASHVAC – Rule 4-10

**Rule ID:** 4-10
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Only applies to zones that do not have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

## Rule Logic:

- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - For each space in zone: `for space_p in zone_p.zones:`
        - Check if space(s) is of type that has health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `if space_p.lighting_space_type not in [CORRIDOR_HOSPITAL,LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM,HEALTHCARE_FACILITY_OPERATING_ROOM]:`
            - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = TRUE`
                - For each terminal in zones that meet the applicabliity check: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
                    - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
                        - Get fan system of HVAC system: `fan_system_p = hvac_p.fan_systems`
                        -   Get fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_unoccupied``

**Rule Assertion:**
- Case 1: if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling with load in the P_RMR: ```if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS```

- Case 2: Else:`FAIL and raise_message "FANS ARE NOT MODELED AS CYCLING WITH LOAD DURING UNOCCUPIED HOURS AS EXPECTED."`

**Applicability Checks:** 

 1. Only applies to zones that do not have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
