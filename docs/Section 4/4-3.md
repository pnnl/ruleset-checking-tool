# ASHVAC – Rule 4-3

**Rule ID:** 4-3
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Not applicable for for heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Table G3.1.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

## Rule Logic:
- For each HVAC system in P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:`
    - Get HVAC system status: `status_type_p = hvac_p.status_type:`
        - Check if HVAC system status is new or existing: `if status_type_p in [NEW,EXISTING]:`
            - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = TRUE`
				- For each fan system in each HVAC system that meets the applicabliity check: `fan_systems_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p.fan_systems:`
					- Get minimum OA: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = fan_systems_p. minimum_outdoor_airflow`
					- Get operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_occupied`

**Rule Assertion:**
- Case 1: if minimum OA is greater than 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR: `if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p >0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS`

- Case 2: Else if minimum OA is greater than 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is not set to CONTINUOUS P_RMR: `else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p > 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “KEEP_OFF”: FAIL and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM IS OFF DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS WHEN THE UNIT IS MODELED AS PROVIDING MINUMUM OA CFM IN THE P_RMR.”`

- Case 3: Else if minimum OA is equal to 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is equal to continuous in the P_RMR: `else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: FAIL and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM OPERATES CONTINUOUSLY DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS WHEN IT DOES NOT PROVIDE OA CFM IN THE P_RMR. ”`

- Case 4: Else if minimum OA is equal to 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is set to cycling in the P_RMR: `else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`

- Case 5: Else if minimum OA is equal to 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is set to keep off in the P_RMR: `else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “KEEP_OFF”: FAIL and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM IS SET TO KEEP_OFF DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS IN THE P_RMR WHICH IS UNEXPECTED.”`

- Case 6: Else if minimum OA is equal to 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is set to other in the P_RMR: `else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “OTHER”: FAIL and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM IS SET TO OPERATE WIHT A CONTROL DESRIBED AS OTHER DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS IN THE P_RMR WHICH IS UNEXPECTED.”`

- Case 7: Else, minimim OA and fan control during occupied period is not specified: `Else: CAUTION and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM OCCUPIED CONTROL AND/OR MINIMUM OA CFM IS NOT KNOWN SO THIS RULE COULD NOT BE ASSESSED.”`

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Not applicable for for heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Table G3.1: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
