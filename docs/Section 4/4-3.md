# ASHVAC – Rule 4-3

**Rule ID:** 4-3
**Rule Description:** HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied.
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value
**Appendix G Section:** Section 4 Schedules
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 Section 4 & G3.1.2.4  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  
1.	TBD
2.	TBD
3.	TBD

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

**Applicability Checks:**  
1.	TBD
2.	TBD
3.	TBD


## Rule Logic:
- For each building segment in the proposed model: ```building_segment_p in P_RMR.building.building_segments:```
	- For each HVAC system in each building segment: ```heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p in building_segments_p. heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:```
	 	- For each fan systems in each HVAC system: ```fan_systems_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p.fan_systems:``` 
	 	- Get minimum OA: ```minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = fan_systems_p. minimum_outdoor_airflow```
	 	- Get operation during occupied periods: ```operation_during_occupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_occupied```

**Rule Assertion:**
- Case 1: if minimum OA is greater than 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is equal to continuous in the P_RMR: ```if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p >0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS```

- Case 2: Else if minimum OA is equal to 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is equal to continuous in the P_RMR: ```else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: FAIL and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM OPERATES CONTINUOUSLY DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS WHEN IT DOES NOT PROVIDE OA CFM IN THE P_RMR. ”```

- Case 3: Else if minimum OA is greater than 0 and fan system operation during occupied periods is equal to cycling in the P_RMR: ```else if minimum_outdoor_airflow_p > 0 and operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING”: FAIL and raise_warning “FAN SYSTEM OPERATES AS CYCLING WITH HEATING AND COOLING LOADS DURING OCCUPIED PERIODS WHEN IT PROVIDES OA CFM IN THE P_RMR.  FAIL UNLESS TABLE G3.1 #4 proposed exception #1 IS APPLICABLE. ”```
