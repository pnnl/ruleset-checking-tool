# ASHVAC – Rule 4-6

**Rule ID:** 4-6
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans shall remain on during occupied and unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 exception #3 Schedules for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. P-PRM is modeled with a least one computer room space. 

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

## Rule Logic:
- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - For each space in zone: `for space_p in zone_p.zones:`
        - Check if space(s) is of type that has health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `if space_p.lighting_space_type in [COMPUTER_ROOM]:`
            - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = TRUE`
                - For each terminal in zones that meet the applicabliity check: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
                    - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
                        - Get fan system of HVAC system: `fan_system_p = hvac_p.fan_systems`
                        -   Get fan system operating schedule: `operating_schedule_p = fan_system_p.operating_schedule`

  **Rule Assertion:**
  - Case 1: For each applicable fan system the fan schedule is 1 for all hour: `if operating_schedule_p[i] == 1 for i in range(8760): PASS`

  -Case 2: Else:`FAIL and raise_message "FANS ARE NOT MODELED AS ON ALL HOURS WHEN THE SPACE IS A COMPUTER ROOM."`

**Applicability Checks:** 

 1. P-PRM is modeled with a least one computer room space: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
