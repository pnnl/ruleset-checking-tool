## Rule Logic:   

Get the fenestration area for each unique orientation (i.e., azimuth) and then check if the minimum and maximum areas differ by 5% or more
- Create a blank dictionary that will have all unique azimuths paired with the total vertical fenestration area: `azimuth_fen_area_dict_b = {}`  
- For each building in the B_RMD: `for bldg in B_RMD.buildings:`    
    - For each building_segment in the bldg: `for bldg_seg in bldg.building_segments`      
        - For each zone in the building_segment: `for zone in bldg_seg.zones`   
            - For each surface in zone: `for surface in zone.surfaces:`  
                - Check if surface is above-grade wall: `if get_opaque_surface_type(surface) == "ABOVE-GRADE WALL":`   
                    - Get the azimuth: `surface_azimuth = surface.azimuth`  
                    - Check if the azimuth is not in a key in the dictionary of azimuths and fen area, if it is not then add it: `if surface_azimuth not in azimuth_fen_area_dict_b:`   
                        - Add the unique azimuth to the dictionary as a key and set initial fen area to 0: `azimuth_fen_area_dict_b[surface_azimuth]= 0`  
                    - Reset the total surface fenestration area variable to 0: `total_surface_fenestration_area = 0`  
                    - For each subsurface associated with the surface: `for sub_surface in surface.subsurfaces:`   
                        - Check if subsurface is door: `if sub_surface.classification == "DOOR":`
                            - If glazed area in door is more than 50% of the total door area, add door area to total_surface_fenestration_area: `if sub_surface.glazed_area > subsurface.opaque_area: total_surface_fenestration_area += sub_surface.glazed_area + sub_surface.opaque_area`
                        - Else, subsurface is not door, add total area to total_surface_fenestration_area (because we checked that the surface is an above grade wall we can assume that the subsurface classification is not and could not be a skylight so no need to check this): `total_surface_fenestration_area += subsurface.glazed_area + subsurface.opaque_area`      
                    - Add the total_surface_fenestration_area summed for the surface to the total fen area associated with the azimuth: `azimuth_fen_area_dict_b[surface_azimuth] += total_surface_fenestration_area`    

- Loop through the dictionary keys and put the area in bins depending on the azimuth (bins will be in 3 degree increments). Use this logic: if azimuth >= 0 and < 3  then put area in the 0-3 bin, if azimuth >=3 and < 6 then put the area in the the 3-6 bin, etc. `for azi in azimuth_fen_area_dict_b.keys():`  
    - Lookup the bin that the azimuth falls into based on the value of the azimuth using this logic. Bin lookup table based on this logic: if azimuth >= 0 and < 3  then put the fen area in the 0-3 bin, if azimuth >=3 and < 6 then put the area in the the 3-6 bin, etc. (this assumes the RCT team will create a lookup table to make it easy to lookup the bin that the azimuth (azi) falls into): `bin = lookup(azi, lookuptable)`  
    - Add the area to the bin in a revised binned dictionary (bin is key, area is value in dictionary): `azimuth_fen_area_dict_b[bin] += azimuth_fen_area_dict_b[azi]`    

Check if the area differs by 5 percent or more.
- Get the max fen area: `max_fen_area = azimuth_fen_area_dict_b[max(azimuth_fen_area_dict_b, key=azimuth_fen_area_dict_b.get)]`  
- Get the min fen area: `min_fen_area = azimuth_fen_area_dict_b[min(azimuth_fen_area_dict_b, key=azimuth_fen_area_dict_b.get)]`  
- Calculate the % difference, take the maximum calculated: `percent_difference = max(abs(max_fen_area- min_fen_area)/max_fen_area,abs(min_fen_area- max_fen_area)/min_fen_area)` 
- Check if the % difference is 5% or more, if it is then set rotation_expected_b boolean to TRUE: `if percent_difference >= 5%: rotation_expected_b = TRUE`  
- Else, set rotation_expected_b to FALSE: `else: rotation_expected_b = FALSE`  

- Set no_of_output_instance variable to 0 (counts the number of output instances): `no_of_output_instance =0`
Determine which RMDs have been created/provided
- Create variable for list of RMDs: `rmds = RulesetProjectDescription.ruleset_model_descriptions`
- Check for user RMD: `has_user = any[rmd.type == USER for rmd in rmds]`  
- Check for proposed RMD: `has_proposed = any[rmd.type == PROPOSED for rmd in rmds]`
- Check for baseline 0 degree RMD: `has_baseline_0 = any[rmd.type == BASELINE_0 for rmd in rmds]`
- Check for baseline 90 degree RMD: `has_baseline_90 = any[rmd.type == BASELINE_90 for rmd in rmds]`
- Check for baseline 180 degree RMD: `has_baseline_180 = any[rmd.type == BASELINE_180 for rmd in rmds]`
- Check for baseline 270 degree RMD: `has_baseline_270 = any[rmd.type == BASELINE_270 for rmd in rmds]`    
- Get the number of ruleset_model_descriptions: `no_of_rmds = len(rmds)`  

- Check that there is an output_instance associated with each RMD and add to the no_of_output_instance variable for each one `For rmd in rmds:`  
    - Check for proposed output: `if rmd.type == PROPOSED and rmd.output.Output2019ASHRAE901.output_instance != Null: has_proposed_output = TRUE`
    - Check for baseline 0 degree output: `if rmd.type == BASELINE_0 and rmd.output.Output2019ASHRAE901.output_instance != Null: has_baseline_0_output = TRUE`
    - Check for baseline 90 degree output: `if rmd.type == BASELINE_90 and rmd.output.Output2019ASHRAE901.output_instance != Null: has_baseline_90_output = TRUE`
    - Check for baseline 180 degree output: `if rmd.type == BASELINE_180 and rmd.output.Output2019ASHRAE901.output_instance != Null: has_baseline_180_output = TRUE`
    - Check for baseline 270 degree output: `if rmd.type == BASELINE_270 and rmd.output.Output2019ASHRAE901.output_instance != Null: has_baseline_270_output = TRUE` 
    - Check if there is an output_instance associated with the RMD: `if rmd.output.Output2019ASHRAE901.output_instance != Null: no_of_output_instance += 1 `
    
- **Rule Assertion:** 
- Case 1: If the fenestration area differs by 5% or more by orientation and there are 6 RMIs (for user, proposed, baseline at 0 degrees, baseline at 90 degrees, baseline at 180 degrees, and baseline at 270 degrees) and 5 output files (excludes an output for the user model) then Pass: `if rotation_expected_b == TRUE and has_user == TRUE and has_proposed == TRUE and has_baseline_0 == TRUE and has_baseline_90 == TRUE and has_baseline_180 == TRUE and has_baseline_270 == TRUE and has_proposed_output == TRUE and has_baseline_0_output == TRUE and has_baseline_90_output == TRUE and has_baseline_180_output == TRUE and has_baseline_270_output == TRUE and no_of_rmds == 6 and no_of_output_instance == 5: outcome = "PASS" `  
- Case 2: Else if rotation is not expected then pass as long as they have the minimally required RMDs and outputs: `if rotation_expected_b == FALSE and has_user == TRUE and has_proposed == TRUE and has_baseline_0 == TRUE and has_proposed_output == TRUE and has_baseline_0_output == TRUE: outcome = "PASS" `  
- Case 43: Else: `Else: outcome = "FAIL" and raise_message "Fail unless Table G3.1#5a exception #2 is applicable and it can be demonstrated that the building orientation is dictated by site considerations.`
