# Airside System - Rule 23-11 

**Schema Version:** 0.0.34  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 23-11  
**Rule Description:** System 11 Supply air temperature shall be reset from minimum supply air temp at 50% cooling load to room temp at 0% cooling load.    
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.17 System 11 Supply Air Temperature and Fan Control  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-11.  

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. baseline_system_type_compare()

**Applicability Checks:**  
- create a list of the target system types: `APPLICABLE_SYS_TYPES = [HVAC_SYS.SYS_11]`
- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_system_types_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

- loop through the applicable system types: `for target_sys_type in APPLICABLE_SYS_TYPES:`
    - and loop through the baseline_system_types_dict to check the system types of the baseline systems: `for system_type in baseline_system_types_dict:`
        - do baseline_system_type_compare to determine whether the baseline_system_type is the applicable_system_type: `if((baseline_system_type_compare(system_type, target_sys_type, false)):`
            - the systems in the list: baseline_system_types_dict[system_type] are sys-11 - loop through the list of systems: `for hvac_system_id in baseline_system_types_dict[system_type]:`
            - `CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
            - otherwise, rule not applicable: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`
            
  **Rule Logic:**
  - create boolean for whether rule passes: `rule_passes = TRUE`
  - get the hvac system: `hvac_system = get_object_by_id(hvac_system_id)`
  - get the fan_system: `fan_system = hvac_system.fan_system`
  - check whether the fan_system.temperature_control is LOAD_RESET_TO_SPACE_TEMPERATURE, other reset options do not result in correct control: `if fan_system.temperature_control == LOAD_RESET_TO_SPACE_TEMPERATURE:`
      - get the fan_system reset_differential_temperature - this temperature is added to the terminal.supply_design_cooling_setpoint temperature to give the supply air temperature at minimum cooling load: `reset_diff_temp = fan_system.reset_differential_temperature`
      - we now need to check each zone and terminal for compliance - look through each zone: `for zone in B-RMR...zones:`
          - get the zone design cooling setpoint: `zone_cooling_setpoint = zone.design_thermostat_cooling_setpoint`
          - look at each terminal and check compliance if the terminal is connected to system 11: `for terminal in zone.terminals:`
              - check to see if the terminal is connected to the hvac_system: `if terminal.served_by_heating_ventilating_air_conditioning_system == hvac_system_id:`
                  - check to see if the reset_diff_temp added to the terminal.supply_design_cooling_setpoint_temperature DOES NOT equal the zone_cooling_setpoint, set rule_passes to FALSE: `if((reset_diff_temp + terminal.supply_design_cooling_setpoint_temperature) !=  zone_cooling_setpoint): rule_passes = FALSE`
  - otherwise, rule does not pass: `else: rule_passes = FALSE`
 
  **Rule Assertion:**
  - Case 1: the rule_passes variable is TRUE, the rule passes: `if rule_passes == TRUE: PASS`
  - Case 2: all other cases, the rule fails: `else: FALSE`
**Notes:**
1. this rule checks the design temperatures for compliance, however, with a variable cooling thermostat schedule, this could pass projects that do not take this into account
