# Airside System - Rule 23-10  

**Rule ID:** 23-10  
**Rule Description:** System 5-8 and 11 - part load VAV fan power shall be modeled using either method 1 or 2 in Table G3.1.3.15. This rule will only validate data points from Method-1 Part-load Fan Power Data.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.15 VAV Fan Part-Load Performance (Systems 5 through 8 and 11)  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-5, 6, 7, 8 or 11  

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** Table G3.1.3.15  
**Function Call:**  

1. baseline_hvac_type()  

## Rule Logic:  

- For each building segment in B_RMR: `for building_segment_b in B_RMR...building_segments:`

  - Get HVAC system: `hvac_b = building_segment_b.heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`

    - Check if HVAC system is type 5, 6, 7, 8 or 11: `if baseline_hvac_type(hvac_b) in ["SYS-5", "SYS-6", "SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11"]:`

      - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = TRUE`

      - Get fan system serving HVAC system: `fan_system_b = hvac_b.fan_systems[0]` (See Note#1)

        - For fan system supply, return and relief fan: `for fan_b in [fan_system_b.supply_fan, fan_system_b.return_fan, fan_system_b.relief_fan]:`

          **Rule Assertion:**

          - Case 1: For supply, return and relief fan in each fan system serving Baseline system type 5, 6, 7, 8 or 11, if fan part-load VAV is modeled as per Table G3.1.3.15: `if fan_b.output_validation_points[i] == data_lookup(table_G_3_1_3_15, i) for i in [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]: PASS`

          - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-5, 6, 7, 8 or 11: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`

**[Back](../_toc.md)**

**Notes:**

1. For baseline hvac.fan_systems, assuming only one fan system is modeled. Might need a separate check for this. Note from schema: "Normally one fan system is used but second fan systems may be used when a direct outdoor air system is used."

2. RDS assumes exhaust fan in HVAC system could be constant. Please confirm this approach is valid.
