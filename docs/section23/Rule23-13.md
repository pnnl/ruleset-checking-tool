# Airside System - Rule 23-16 

**Schema Version:** 0.0.34  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 23-16  
**Rule Description:** If proposed design includes humidistatic controls then the baseline shall use mechanical cooling for dehumidification and shall reheat to avoid overcooling.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.18 Dehumidification (Systems 3 through 8 and 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. P-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that includes humidistatic controls.  

**Function Calls:**  


**Applicability Checks:**  
- For each hvac_p in the P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...HeatingVentilatingAirConditioningSystem:`
    - get the heating system: `heating_system_p = hvac_p.heating_system`
    - check to see if the heating system has a humidification type other than NONE, if so, there are humidification controls and the rule is applicable: `if heating_system_p.humidification_type != NONE:`
        - the rule is applicable: `APPLICABLE`
    - get the cooling system: `cooling_system_p = hvac_p.cooling_system`
    - check to see if the cooling system has a humidification type other than NONE, if so, there are humidification controls and the rule is applicable: `if cooling_system_p.humidification_type != NONE:`
        - the rule is applicable: `APPLICABLE`
- if we make it down here without triggering an applicable result, the rule is not applicable: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
