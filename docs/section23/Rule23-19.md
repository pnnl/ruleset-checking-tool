# Airside System - Rule 23-19  

**Rule ID:** 23-19  
**Rule Description:** Systems 5 - 8, the baseline system shall be modeled with preheat coils controlled to a fixed set point 20F less than the design room heating temperature setpoint.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.19 Preheat Coils (Systems 5 through 8)  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-5, 6, 7, 8  

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. baseline_hvac_type()  

## Rule Logic:  

- For each zone in B_RMR: `for zone_b in B_RMR...zones:`

  - For each terminal in zone: `for terminal_b in zone_b.terminals:`

    - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_b = terminal_b.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
  
      - Check if HVAC system is type 5 through 8: `if baseline_hvac_type(hvac_b) in ["SYS-5", "SYS-6", "SYS-5", "SYS-8"]:`

        - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = TRUE`

        - Get zone design heating temperature setpoint: `zone_heating_setpoint_b = zone_b.design_thermostat_heating_setpoint`

        - Save HVAC system and zone design heating temperature setpoint if temperature is higher than current value saved: `if zone_heating_setpoint_b > hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict[hvac_b]: hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict[hvac_b] = zone_heating_setpoint_b`

- For each HVAC system that is type 5 through 8: `for hvac_b in hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict.keys():`

  - Get preheat system of HVAC system: `preheat_b = hvac_b.preheat_system`

    **Rule Assertion:**

    - Case 1: For each Baseline system type 5, 6, 7, or 8, if preheat coils is controlled to a fixed set point 20F less than the design room heating temperature setpoint: `if preheat_b.heating_coil_setpoint == hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict[hvac_b] - 20: PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-5, 6, 7 or 8: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
