# Airside System - Rule 23-14 

**Schema Version:** 0.0.34  
**Mandatory Rule:** False  
**Rule ID:** 23-14  
**Rule Description:** If the baseline system does not comply with exceptions in Section 6.5.2.3 then only 25% of the system reheat energy shall be included in the baseline building performance  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.18 Dehumidification (Systems 3 through 8 and 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** HVAC System  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. P-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that includes humidistatic controls.  

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys


**Applicability Checks:**  
- get a list of the hvac systems and the zones they served in the P_RMR: `hvac_systems_and_zones_p = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(P_RMR)`
- look through each hvac system in the proposed: `for hvac_p_id in hvac_systems_and_zones_p:`
    - get the proposed hvac sytem: `hvac_p = get_object_by_id(hvac_p_id)`
    - get the cooling system: `cooling_system_p = hvac_p.cooling_system`
    - check to see if the cooling system has a humidification type other than NONE, if so, there are humidification controls = TRUE: `if cooling_system_p.humidification_type != NONE: `
        - look through each zone served by the system: `for zone_id in hvac_systems_and_zones_p[hvac_p_id]["ZONE_LIST"]:`
            - get the zone: `zone_p = get_object_by_id(zone_id)`
            - if the zone_p.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule exists, the rule is applicable, return UNDETERMIEND: `if zone_p.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: UNDETERMINED`
    - if we make it down here without triggering an applicable result, the rule is not applicable: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
