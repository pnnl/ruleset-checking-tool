# Airside System - Rule 23-14 

**Schema Version:** 0.0.34  
**Mandatory Rule:** False  
**Rule ID:** 23-14  
**Rule Description:** If the baseline system does not comply with exceptions in Section 6.5.2.3 then only 25% of the system reheat energy shall be included in the baseline building performance  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.18 Dehumidification (Systems 3 through 8 and 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** HVAC System  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. P-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that includes humidistatic controls.  

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys


**Applicability Checks:**  
- get a list of the hvac systems and the zones they served in the P_RMR: `hvac_systems_and_zones_p = get_dict_of_zones_and_terminal_units_served_by_hvac_sys(P_RMR)`
- look through each hvac system in the proposed: `for hvac_p_id in hvac_systems_and_zones_p:`
    - get the proposed hvac sytem: `hvac_p = get_object_by_id(hvac_p_id)`
    - set a boolean has_humidifcation_controls equal to false: `has_humidifcation_controls = FALSE`
    - get the heating system: `heating_system_p = hvac_p.heating_system`
    - check to see if the heating system has a humidification type other than NONE, if so, there are humidification controls, set has_humidifcation_controls to TRUE: `if heating_system_p.humidification_type != NONE: has_humidifcation_controls = TRUE`
    - get the cooling system: `cooling_system_p = hvac_p.cooling_system`
    - check to see if the cooling system has a humidification type other than NONE, if so, there are humidification controls set has_humidifcation_controls = TRUE: `if cooling_system_p.dehumidification_type != NONE: has_humidifcation_controls = TRUE`
    - if there are humidity controls, we will now check for zone humidity setpoint schedules: `if has_humidifcation_controls:`
        - create a list zones_with_humidity_schedules_list: `zones_with_humidity_schedules_list = []`
        - look through each zone served by the system: `for zone_id in hvac_systems_and_zones_p[hvac_p_id]["ZONE_LIST"]:`
            - get the zone: `zone_p = get_object_by_id(zone_id)`
            - if the zone_p.minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule exists, the rule is applicable, set add the zone_id to zones_with_humidity_schedules_list: `if zone_p.minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: zones_with_humidity_schedules_list << zone_id`
            - if the zone_p.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule exists, add the zone_id to the zones_with_humidity_schedules_list: `if zone_p.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule: zones_with_humidity_schedules_list << zone_id`
    - erase any duplicates on zones_with_humidity_schedules_list by calling uniq!: `zones_with_humidity_schedules_list.uniq!`
    - if zones_with_humidity_schedules_list has any zones on the list, the rule is applicable, return APPLICABLE and a not letting the user know which zones have humidity schedules: `if len(zones_with_humidity_schedules_list)> 0: UNDETERMINED; note = "The following zones have humidity schedules: " + zones_with_humidity_schedules_list`
    - if we make it down here without triggering an applicable result, the rule is not applicable: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
