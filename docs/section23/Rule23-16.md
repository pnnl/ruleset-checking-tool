# Airside System - Rule 23-16 

**Schema Version:** 0.0.23  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 23-16  
**Rule Description:** Systems 5 - 8, the baseline system shall be modeled with preheat coils controlled to a fixed set point 20F less than the design room heating temperature setpoint.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMI = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 23 Air-side  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.19 Preheat Coils (Systems 5 through 8)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMI is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-5, 6, 7, 8, 7a, 8a, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 7c.  

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- Get B-RMI system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMI)`

  - Check if B-RMI is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-5, 6, 7, 8, 7a, 8a, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 7c, continue to rule logic: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-5", "SYS-6", "SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-7A", "SYS-8A", "SYS-5B", "SYS-6B", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-7C"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMI: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  
- Create a list of the ids of the hvac systems that are one of the targeted system types: `eligible_systems = []`
- For each baseline system type in the baseline_hvac_system_dict: `for baseline_system_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict:`
  - check if the baseline_system_type is one of 6, 8, 8a, 6b, 8b: `if baseline_system_type in ["SYS-5", "SYS-6", "SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-7A", "SYS-8A", "SYS-5B", "SYS-6B", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-7C"]:`
    - add the hvac_ids for this system type to the list of eligible_systems: `eligible_systems += baseline_hvac_system_dict[baseline_system_type]`

- For each zone in B_RMI: `for zone_b in B_RMI...zones:`

  - For each terminal in zone: `for terminal_b in zone_b.terminals:`

    - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_b = terminal_b.served_by_heating_ventilating_air_conditioning_system`
  
    - Check if HVAC system is type 5, 6, 7, 8, 7a, 8a, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 7c: `if hvac_b.id in eligible_systems:`

      - Get zone design heating temperature setpoint: `zone_heating_setpoint_b = zone_b.design_thermostat_heating_setpoint`

      - Save HVAC system and zone design heating temperature setpoint if temperature is higher than current value saved: `if zone_heating_setpoint_b > hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict[hvac_b]: hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict[hvac_b] = zone_heating_setpoint_b`

- For each HVAC system that is type 5, 6, 7, 8, 7a, 8a, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 7c: `for hvac_b in hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict.keys():`

  - Get preheat system of HVAC system: `preheat_b = hvac_b.preheat_system`

    **Rule Assertion:**

    - Case 1: For each Baseline system type 5, 6, 7, 8, 7a, 8a, 5b, 6b, 7b, 8b, 7c, if preheat system is a coil connected to heating hot water loop, and preheat coils is controlled to a fixed set point 20F less than the design room heating temperature setpoint: `if ( preheat_b.heating_system_type == "FLUID_LOOP" ) AND ( get_component_by_id(preheat_b.hot_water_loop).type == "HEATING" ) AND ( preheat_b.heating_coil_setpoint == hvac_max_zone_setpoint_dict[hvac_b] - 20F ): PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

1. Updated the Rule ID from 23-19 to 23-16 on 11/28/2022
