# Chiller - Rule 22-37  

**Rule ID:** 22-37  
**Primary Rule:** False  
**Rule Description:** Baseline systems served by purchased chilled water loop shall be modeled with a distribution pump with a variable speed drive.
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMD = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 Chiller  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** G3.1.3.10  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.25 

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMI  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Check for purchased chilled water in Baseline

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. check_purchased_chw_hhw()


**Applicability Checks:**

- Check if B-RMI is modeled with purchased chilled water or purchased hot water/steam: `purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict = check_purchased_chw_hhw(B_RMI)`

  - If B-RMI is modeled with purchased cooling, rule is applicable, continue to rule logic: `if purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_COOLING"]: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule not applicable: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  


**Rule Assertion:**

- Case 1:  `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "B-RMI IS MODELED WITH PURCHASED COOLING. VERIFY PURCHASED CHILLED WATER IS MODELED WITH A DISTRIBUTION PUMP WITH A VARIABLE SPEED DRIVE."`


**Notes:**
1.  Applicability check - Rule Test group decided on 3/16/2023 that using the `check_purchased_chw_hhw` function for applicability for non-primary rules was the preferred method vs checking for specific baseline HVAC system types.  This allows the rule to be flagged even if the baseline HVAC system types aren't modeled 100% correctly.
