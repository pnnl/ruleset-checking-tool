# CHW&CW - Rule 22-15  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.25    
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-15  
**Rule Description:** Heat Rejection Device Approach calaculated correctly (T/F), Approach = 25.72-(0.24*WB)  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.11  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatRejection  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with heat rejection loop

**Function Call:**  

1. get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- The function get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems() returns a list of loops that are connected to Type 7,8,12,13,7b,8b,12b.  Get the list of applicable heat rejection loops: `heat_rejection_loop_ids_b = get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems(B_RMI)`

- check applicability for each HeatRejection in the model: `for heat_rejection in B_RMI.heat_rejections:`

  - check if heat_rejection fluid_loop is one of the applicable loops: `if heat_rejection.loop.id in heat_rejection_loop_ids_b:`
  
    - check if the design wetbulb temperature is between 55 and 90F (inclusive): `if ( heat_rejection.design_wetbulb_temperature >= 55 ) AND ( heat_rejection.design_wetbulb_temperature <= 90 ): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

    - Else, rule is not applicable to the heat rejection: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to the heat rejection: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

  ## Rule Logic:  

  - get the approach: `approach_b = heat_rejection.approach`
  - calculate the target approach (all temperature units in Farenheit): `target_approach = 25.72 - (0.24 * heat_rejection.design_wetbulb_temperature)`  

    **Rule Assertion - HeatRejection:**

    - Case 1: If the appraoch equals the target approach, PASS: `if ( approach_b == target_approach ): PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`


**Notes:**

1.  I believe this should be applicable only for design wetbulb temperatures between 55 and 90F
