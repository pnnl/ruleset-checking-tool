# Section 19 - Rule 22-41    
**Schema Version:** 0.0.25   
**Mandatory Rule:** False    
**Rule ID:** 22-41      
**Rule Description:** Purchased CHW systems must be modeled with only one external fluid loop in the baseline design.       
**Rule Assertion:** Options are UNDETERMINED/NOT_APPLICABLE     
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.3 System-Specific Baseline HVAC System Requirements      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. check_purchased_chw_hhw()


**Applicability Checks:**

- Check if B-RMI is modeled with purchased chilled water or purchased hot water/steam: `purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict = check_purchased_chw_hhw(B_RMI)`

  - If B-RMI is modeled with purchased cooling, rule is applicable, continue to rule logic: `if purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_COOLING"]: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule not applicable: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  


**Rule Assertion:**

- Case 1:  `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "B-RMI IS MODELED WITH PURCHASED CHILLED WATER. VERIFY THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PURCHASED CHILLED WATER LOOP IN THE BASELINE MODEL."`


**Notes:**
1.  Applicability check - Rule Test group decided on 3/16/2023 that using the `check_purchased_chw_hhw` function for applicability for non-primary rules was the preferred method vs checking for specific baseline HVAC system types.  This allows the rule to be flagged even if the baseline HVAC system types aren't modeled 100% correctly.
