# CHW&CW - Rule 22-32  

**Rule ID:** 22-32  
**Rule Description:** The baseline building designâ€™s chiller plant shall be modeled with chillers having the number as indicated in Table G3.1.3.7 as a function of building peak cooling load.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.1 Type and Number of Chillers (System 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13)  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** Table G3.1.3.7  
**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-11B", "SYS-12B", "SYS-13B"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For building peak cooling load in B_RMR: `building_peak_load_b = building_b.peak_cooling_load:` (Note XC, treat all buildings in one RMR as one building; pending schema element for building peak load.)

  - Check if building peak cooling load is 300 tons or less: `if building_peak_load_b <= 300 * CONVERSION(TON_TO_BTUH):`

    - Set target chiller number as 1: `target_chiller_number = 1`

  - Else if building peak cooling load is less than 600 tons: `else if building_peak_load_b < 600 * CONVERSION(TON_TO_BTUH):`

    - Set target chiller number as 2: `target_chiller_number = 2`

  - Else, building peak cooling load is 600 tons or more: `else:`

    - Set target chiller number to be a minimum of 2 with chillers added so that no chiller size larger than 800 tons: `target_chiller_number = MAX(2, int(math.ceil(building_peak_load_b/800)))`

**Rule Assertion - Component:**

- Case 1: If number of chillers is modeled correctly: `if LEN(B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.chillers) == target_chiller_number: PASS`

- Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`
