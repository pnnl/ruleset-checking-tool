# CHW&CW - Rule 22-25  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.10 **Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-25  
**Rule Description:** For baseline chilled-water systems served by chiller(s), the primary pump shall be modeled as constant volume.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-water pumps (Systems 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with primary-secondary configuration.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops()
3. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-11B", "SYS-12B", "SYS-13B"]): NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

- **Check 2:** Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMR: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops(B_RMR, "COOLING")`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with primary secondary configuration, continue to rule logic: `if LEN(primary_secondary_loop_dictionary) != 0: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:

- For each pump in B_RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.pumps:`

  - Save loop served by pump and pump to a dictionary: `loop_pump_dictionary[pump_b.loop_or_piping].append(pump_b)`

- For each primary loop in B-RMR: `for primary_loop_id_b in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary.keys():`

  - For each pump serving primary loop: `for pump_b in loop_pump_dictionary[primary_loop_id_b]:`

    **Rule Assertion - Component:**

    - Case 1: If pump serving primary loop is modeled as constant volume: `if pump_b.speed_control == FIXED_SPEED: PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`
