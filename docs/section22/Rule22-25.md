# CHW&CW - Rule 22-25  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.10 **Mandatory Rule:** True
**Rule ID:** 22-25  
**Rule Description:** For chilled-water systems served by chiller(s) and does not serve baseline System-11, the baseline building constant-volume primary pump power shall be modeled as 9 W/gpm.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-water pumps (Systems 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is not modeled with any system that is Type-11.1, 11.2 or 11.1b.
3. Primary and secondary CHW loops are modeled correctly in B-RMR.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops()
3. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1&2:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s): `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-12B", "SYS-13B"]):`
  
    - Check if B-RMR is modeled with any air-side system that is Type-11.1, 11.2 or 11.1b, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-11B"]): RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

    - Else, continue to the next applicability check: `else: NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`

- **Check 3:** Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMR: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops(B_RMR, "COOLING")`

  - Check if primary and secondary loops are modeled correctly, continue to rule logic: `if primary_secondary_loop_dictionary["PRIMARY"] AND primary_secondary_loop_dictionary["SECONDARY"]: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:

- For each pump in B_RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.pumps:`

  - Save loop served by pump and pump to a dictionary: `loop_pump_dictionary[pump_b.loop_or_piping].append(pump)`

- For each primary CHW loop: `for loop_b_id in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary["PRIMARY"]:`

  **Rule Assertion - Component:**

  - Case 1: If primary loop pump power is modeled as 9W/gpm: `if get_component_by_id(loop_id_b).pump_power_per_flow_rate == 9: PASS`

  - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Notes:**

1. Updated the Rule ID from 22-26 to 22-25 on 7/26/2022
