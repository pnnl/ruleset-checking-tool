**Schema Version:** 0.0.37    
**Mandatory Rule:** FALSE  
**Rule ID:** 22-17  
**Rule Description:** The baseline heat rejection device shall have an efficiency of 38.2 gpm/hp  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.11  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatRejection  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with heat rejection loop

**Function Call:**  

1. get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- The function get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems() returns a list of loops that are connected to Type 7,8,12,13,7b,8b,12b.  Get the list of applicable heat rejection loops: `heat_rejection_loop_ids = get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems(B_RMI)`

- check applicability for each HeatRejection in the model: `for heat_rejection in B_RMI.heat_rejections:`

  - check if heat_rejection fluid_loop is one of the applicable loops, if so, continue to the rule logic: `if heat_rejection.loop.id in heat_rejection_loop_ids: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
  
  - Else, rule is not applicable to the heat rejection: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

  ## Rule Logic:  
  
  - create a flag fully_calculated and set it to false: `fully_calculated = FALSE`
  - check if the fan motor nameplate power is given: `if heat_rejection.fan_motor_nameplate_power != NULL:`
    - calculate the jeat rejection efficiency in gpm/hp by dividing the heat rejection water flow rate by the fan motor nameplate power - not to dev team - make sure to convert fan_motor_nameplate_power to HP: `heat_rejection_efficiency = heat_rejection.rated_water_flowrate / heat_rejection.fan_motor_nameplate_power`
    - set fully_calculated to true: `fully_calculated = TRUE`
    - continue to rule assertion: `GO TO RULE ASSERTION`
  - otherwise, with no fan_motor_nameplate_power, we can't fully evaluate the rule, but if fan_shaft_power is given, we can do an advisory calculation: `if heat_rejction.fan_shaft_power != NULL:`
    - calculate the motor nameplate hp based on the equation: Motor nameplate hp (IP units) = fan_shaft_power (hp, IP units)/LF with LF = 90% - note to dev team - make sure to convert fan_shaft_power to hp: `motor_nameplate_hp = heat_rejection.fan_shaft_power / 0.9`
    - calculate the heat rejection efficiency in gpm/hp based on the water flow rate and calculated motor nameplate hp: `heat_rejection_efficiency = heat_rejection.rated_water_flowrate / motor_nameplate_hp`
  - GO TO RULE ASSERTION

  **Rule Assertion - HeatRejection:**
  - Case 1: the result was fully calculated, and the calculated heat_rejection_efficiency matches the expected 38.2 gpm/hp, then PASS: `if fully_calculated and heat_rejection_efficiency == 38.2: PASS`
  - Case 2: the result was fully calculated, and the calculated heat rejection efficiency doesn't match 38.2 gpm/hp, then FAIL: `if fully_calculated and heat_rejection_efficiency != 38.2: FAIL`
  - Case 3: the result was not fully calculated and the calculated heat_rejection_efficiency matches the expected 38.2 gpm/hp, then UNDETERMINED and provide a note: `if not fully_calculated and heat_rejection_efficiency == 38.2: UNDETERMINED; note = "The heat rejection fan motor nameplate power was not given, so we calculated the fan motor nameplate power based on the equation: Motor Nameplate Power = Fan Shaft Power / LF, where LF = 90%.  Based on this calculation for motor nameplate power, we calculated a correct efficiency of 38.2 gpm/hp."`
  - Case 4: the result was not fully calculated and the calculated heat_rejection_efficiency does not match the expected 38.2 gpm/hp, then UNDETERMINED and provide a note: `if not fully_calculated and heat_rejection_efficiency != 38.2: UNDETERMINED; note = "The heat rejection fan motor nameplate power was not given, so we calculated the fan motor nameplate power based on the equation: Motor Nameplate Power = Fan Shaft Power / LF, where LF = 90%.  Based on this calculation for motor nameplate power, we calculated an efficiency of " + heat_rejection_efficiency + " gpm/hp."`
  - Case 5: heat_rejection_efficiency was not calculated: UNDETERMINED and provide a note: `if heat_rejection_efficiency == NULL: UNDETERMINED; note = "The heat rejection fan motor nameplate power was not given, nor was the fan shaft power.  We were unable to calculate the efficiency."`
