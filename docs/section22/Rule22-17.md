# CHW&CW - Rule 22-17  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.25    
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-17  
**Rule Description:** The baseline heat rejection device shall have an efficiency of 38.2 gpm/hp  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.11
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatRejection 
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with heat rejection loop

**Function Call:**  

1. get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- The function get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems() returns a list of loops that are connected to Type 7,8,12,13,7b,8b,12b.  Get the list of applicable heat rejection loops: `heat_rejection_loop_ids = get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems(B_RMI)`

- check applicability for each HeatRejection in the model: `for heat_rejection in B_RMI.heat_rejections:`

  - check if heat_rejection fluid_loop is one of the applicable loops, if so, continue to the rule logic: `if heat_rejection.loop.id in heat_rejection_loop_ids: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
  
  - Else, rule is not applicable to the heat rejection: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

  ## Rule Logic:  

  - get the fan_electric_input_power for the heat rjection: `fan_W = heat_rejection.fan_nameplate_power`
  
  - get the rated water flow rate (assumed to be gpm): `rated_water_flowrate = heat_rejection.rated_water_flowrate`
  
  - calculate the efficiency in gpm/hp, the following equation includes a conversion from Watts to hp: `heat_rejection_efficiency = rated_water_flowrate / (fan_W * 0.00134102)`

  **Rule Assertion - HeatRejection:**

  - Case 1: check for conservative outcome allowed: `if ( ahj_flag AND ( heat_rejection_efficiency > 38.2 ): PASS`
  
  - Case 2: elsif  the heat_rejection_efficiency equals 38.2 gpm/hp, PASS, but include note: `if ( heat_rejection_efficiency == 38.2 ): PASS; note: "Ensure that the efficiency is specified at the design rating conditions per table 6.8.1-7"`

  - Case 3: Else: `else: FAIL`


**Notes:**

1.  how to convert to hp for the purpose of this rule?
2.  I used `rated_water_flow_rate`, but want to confirm that this is correct and it shouldn't be `design_water_flow_rate`
