# CHW&CW - Rule 22-17  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.37    
**Mandatory Rule:** FALSE  
**Rule ID:** 22-17  
**Rule Description:** The baseline heat rejection device shall have an efficiency of 38.2 gpm/hp  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** G3.1.3.11  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Each HeatRejection  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with heat rejection loop

**Function Call:**  

1. get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- The function get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems() returns a list of loops that are connected to Type 7,8,12,13,7b,8b,12b.  Get the list of applicable heat rejection loops: `heat_rejection_loop_ids = get_heat_rejection_loops_connected_to_baseline_systems(B_RMI)`

- check applicability for each HeatRejection in the model: `for heat_rejection in B_RMI.heat_rejections:`

  - check if heat_rejection fluid_loop is one of the applicable loops, if so, continue to the rule logic: `if heat_rejection.loop.id in heat_rejection_loop_ids: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
  
  - Else, rule is not applicable to the heat rejection: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

  ## Rule Logic:  
  
  - set has_fan_motor_nameplate_power flag equal to false: `has_fan_motor_nameplate_power = false`
  
  - create a variable additional_note_for_motor_nameplate_power.  If the heat_rejection has the fan_motor_nameplate_power data element, this note variable will be a blank string, however if there is no fan_motor_nameplate_power, the note will be a string that describes how fan_shaft_power is calculated: `set additional_note_for_motor_nameplate_power = ""`
  
  - check if the heat rejection has fan_motor_nameplate_power (not sure the exact python command for this): `if heat_rejection.fan_motor_nameplate_power:`
  
    - set fan_BHP equal to heat_rejection.fan_motor_nameplate_power (the schema note for fan_motor_nameplate_power is that when the units are in inch-pound the units are fan motor horsepower): `fan_BHP = heat_rejection.fan_motor_nameplate_power`
    
    - set has_fan_motor_nameplate_power flag equal to true: `has_fan_motor_nameplate_power = true`
    
  - otherwise, we need to calculate shaft power based on the motor nameplate power if fan_shaft_power is defined: `elif heat_rejection.fan_shaft_power:`
  
    - set fan_motor_nameplate_power equal to the heat_rejection.fan_shaft_power * (1/0.9) (0.9 is a rule of thumb suggested by Michael Rosenberg in April 2023): `fan_motor_nameplate_power = heat_rejection.fan_shaft_power * 0.9 * heat_rejection.fan_motor_efficiency`
    
    - if the motor nameplate power is not directly entered, we also need to create an additional note to return with the result, describing how the calculation was completed: `addtitional_note_for_no_motor_nameplate_power = "  *Note: The fan motor nameplate power for " + heat_rejection + " was not given.  For this evaluation, the fan motor nameplate power was cacluated using a rule of thumb where fan_motor_nameplate_power = fan_shaft_power * 0.9 * fan_motor_efficiency."`
      
    - calculate fan brake horsepower by multiplying the fan shaft power by 0.00134102 (the conversion from Watts to HP): `fan_BHP = fan_motor_nameplate_power * 0.00134102`

  - otherwise, if there is no fan motor nameplate power or no fan_shaft power, then we can't calculate at all, set a boolean: could_not_calculate to TRUE and go to rule assertion: `else: could_not_calculate = true; GO TO RULE ASSERTION`
 
  - get the rated water flow rate (assumed to be gpm): `rated_water_flowrate = heat_rejection.rated_water_flowrate`
  
  - calculate the efficiency in gpm/hp: `heat_rejection_efficiency = rated_water_flowrate / (fan_BHP)`

  **Rule Assertion - HeatRejection:**
  - Case 1: the result couldn't be calcualted because fan_motor_nameplate_power and fan_shaft_power were not given: `if could_not_calculate: UNDETERMINED; note = "The project includes a cooling tower.  However, we could not calculate the cooling tower efficiency because neither the fan_motor_nameplate_power nor fan_shaft_power were given"`
  - Case 2: check if the efficiency is greater than the rated efficiency: `if ( ahj_flag AND ( heat_rejection_efficiency > 38.2 )): UNDETERMINED; note = "The project includes a cooling tower.  We calculated the cooling tower efficiency to be " + heat_rejection_efficiency + ", which is greater than the required efficiency of 38.2 gpm / hp, resulting in a more stringent baseline. However, it was not possible to verify that the modeling inputs correspond to the rating conditions in Table 6.8.1-7." + additional_note_for_motor_nameplate_power`
  
  - Case 3: elsif  the heat_rejection_efficiency equals 38.2 gpm/hp, PASS, but include note: `if ( heat_rejection_efficiency == 38.2 ): PASS; note = "The project includes a cooling tower.  We calculated the cooling tower efficiency to be correct at 38.2 gpm / hp.  However, it was not possible to verify that the modeling inputs correspond to the rating conditions in Table 6.8.1-7." + additional_note_for_motor_nameplate_power`

  - Case 4: Else: `else: UNDETERMINED; note = "The project includes a cooling tower.  We calculated the cooling tower efficiency to be " + heat_rejection_efficiency + ", which is less than the required efficiency of 38.2 gpm / hp.  However, it was not possible to verify that the modeling inputs correspond to the rating conditions in Table 6.8.1-7.  Please review the efficiency and ensure that it is correct at the rating conditions as specified in the Table 6.8.1-7." + additional_note_for_motor_nameplate_power`


**Notes:**

1.  the variables `fan_motor_nameplate_power`, `fan_shaft_power` & `fan_motor_efficiency` are not yet in the schema.  Were suggested as part of issue 181: https://github.com/open229/ruleset-model-description-schema/issues/181
