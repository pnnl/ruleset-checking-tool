# CHW&CW - Rule 22-36  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.18    
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-36  
**Rule Description:** Baseline chilled water system that does not use purchased chilled water shall be modeled with constant flow primary loop and variable flow secondary loop.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMD = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-Water Pumps (Systems 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMD is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11.1b, 12b.
2. B-RMD is modeled with primary-secondary configuration.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops()
3. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMD system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMD)`

  - Check if B-RMD is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-11B", "SYS-12B", "SYS-13B"]): NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMD: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

- **Check 2:** Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMD: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops(B_RMD)`

  - Check if B-RMD is modeled with primary secondary configuration, continue to rule logic: `if LEN(primary_secondary_loop_dictionary) != 0: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMD: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMD: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops(B_RMD)`

  - For each primary loop: `for primary_loop_id in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary.keys():`

    **Rule Assertion - Component:**

    - Case 1: If primary loop is modeled as constant flow and secondary loop as variable flow: `if ( get_component_by_id(primary_loop_id).cooling_or_condensing_design_and_control.flow_control == "FIXED_FLOW" for primary_loop_id in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary.keys() ) AND ( get_component_by_id(secondary_loop_id).cooling_or_condensing_design_and_control.flow_control == "VARIABLE_FLOW" for secondary_loop_id in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary[primary_loop_id] ): PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`
