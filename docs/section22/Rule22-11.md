# CHW&CW - Rule 22-11  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.10    
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-11  
**Rule Description:** For Baseline chilled-water system that does not use purchased chilled water, variable-flow secondary pump shall be modeled as 13W/gpm at design conditions.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-water pumps (System 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with primary-secondary configuration.

**Function Call:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops_dict()
3. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 12b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-12B"]): NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

- **Check 2:** Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMR: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops_dict(B_RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with primary secondary configuration, continue to rule logic: `if LEN(primary_secondary_loop_dictionary) != 0: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each primary loop in B-RMR: `for primary_loop_id_b in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary.keys():`

  - For each secondary loop under primary loop: `for secondary_loop_id_b in get_component_by_id(primary_loop_id_b).child_loops:`

    - Get secondary loop: `secondary_loop_b = get_component_by_id(secondary_loop_id_b)`

      **Rule Assertion - Component:**

      - Case 1: If secondary pump is modeled as 13W/gpm at design conditions: `if secondary_loop_b.pump_power_per_flow_rate == 13: PASS`

      - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`
