**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-16  
**Rule Description:** The baseline condenser-water design supply temperature shall be calculated using the cooling tower approach to the 0.4% evaporation design wet-bulb temperature, valid for wet-bulbs from 55°F to 90°F.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.11 Heat Rejection (System 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-11B", "SYS-12B"]): NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

- **Check 2:**

  - If any heat rejection device in B_RMR has a reported design wet-bulb temperature between 55°F to 90°F, continue to rule logic: `if any(tower_b.design_wetbulb_temperature >= 55 AND tower_b.design_wetbulb_temperature <=90 for tower_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.heat_rejections): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each heat rejection device in B_RMR: `for tower_b in B_RMR.RulesetModelInstance.heat_rejections:`

  - Get reported design wet-bulb temperature: `wbt_b = tower_b.design_wetbulb_temperature`

  - Get reported approach temperature: `approach_b = tower_b.approach`

  - Get condenser water loop served by heat rejection device: `cw_loop_id_b = tower_b.loop`

    - Get design supply temperature of condenser loop: `supply_temperature_b = get_component_by_id(cw_loop_id_b).cooling_or_condensing_design_and_control.design_supply_temperature`

    **Rule Assertion:**

    - Case 1: For each heat rejection device, if condenser-water design supply temperature is cooling tower approach plus the design wet-bulb temperature: `if supply_temperature_b = approach_b + wbt_b: PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Notes:**

1. Current logic: if multiple heat rejection devices have different wet-bulb temperature, this rule will apply as long as at least one device has WBT between 55 and 90F.
2. Updated the Rule ID from 22-17 to 22-16 on 7/26/2022
