# CHW&CW - Rule 22-34  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.10 **Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-34  
**Rule Description:** Baseline chilled water system that does not use purchased chilled water must only have no more than one CHW plant.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.2 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, 13b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to rule logic: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-11B", "SYS-12B", "SYS-13B"]): CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- Get number of primary loops in B-RMR: `num_loops = LEN(primary_secondary_loop_dictionary)`

**Rule Assertion - Component:**

- Case 1: If only one CHW primary loop is modeled: `if num_loops == 1: PASS`

- Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**[Back](../_toc.md)**

**Notes:**

1. Treat all buildings under RMR as one building.
2. "no more than one CHW plant" means just one CHW primary loop?
3. It seems App. G has no requirement for number of secondary loops.
