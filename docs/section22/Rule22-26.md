# CHW&CW - Rule 22-26  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.10 **Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-26  
**Rule Description:** For chilled-water systems served by chiller(s) and serves baseline System-11, the baseline building constant-volume primary pump power shall be modeled as 12 W/gpm.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-water pumps (Systems 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-11.1, 11.2 or 11.1b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with primary-secondary configuration.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops()
3. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-11.1, 11.2 or 11.1b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-11B"]): NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`
  
  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

- **Check 2:** Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMR: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops(B_RMR, "COOLING")`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with primary secondary configuration, continue to rule logic: `if LEN(primary_secondary_loop_dictionary) != 0: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:

- For each primary loop in B-RMR: `for primary_loop_id_b in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary.keys():`

  **Rule Assertion - Component:**

  - Case 1: If primary loop pump power is modeled as 12W/gpm: `if get_component_by_id(primary_loop_id_b).pump_power_per_flow_rate == 12: PASS`

  - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Notes:**

1. Updated the Rule ID from 22-27 to 22-26 on 7/26/2022
