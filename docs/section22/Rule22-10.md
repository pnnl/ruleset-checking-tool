# CHW&CW - Rule 22-10  

**Schema Version:** 0.0.10  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 22-10  
**Rule Description:** For Baseline chilled water system with cooling capacity less than 300ton, the secondary pump shall be modeled as riding the pump curve. For Baseline chilled water system with cooling capacity of 300 tons or more, the secondary pump shall be modeled with variable-speed drives.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**90.1 Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-water pumps (System 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13)  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b.
2. B-RMR is modeled with primary-secondary configuration.

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()
2. get_primary_secondary_loops_dict()

**Applicability Checks:**  

- **Check 1:** Get B-RMR system types: `baseline_hvac_system_dict = get_baseline_system_types(B-RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11.1, 11.2, 12, 13, 7b, 8b, 11b, 12b, i.e. with air-side system served by chiller(s), continue to the next applicability check: `if any(sys_type in baseline_hvac_system_dict.keys() for sys_type in ["SYS-7", "SYS-8", "SYS-11.1", "SYS-11.2", "SYS-12", "SYS-13", "SYS-7B", "SYS-8B", "SYS-11B", "SYS-12B"]): NEXT_APPLICABILITY_CHECK`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

- **Check 2:** Get primary and secondary loops for B-RMR: `primary_secondary_loop_dictionary = get_primary_secondary_loops_dict(B_RMR)`

  - Check if B-RMR is modeled with primary-secondary configuration, continue to rule logic: `if LEN(primary_secondary_loop_dictionary) != 0: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule is not applicable to B-RMR: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each pump in B_RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.pumps:`

  - Save loop served by pump and pump to a dictionary: `loop_pump_dictionary[pump_b.loop_or_piping].append(pump)`

- For each chiller in B_RMR: `for chiller_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.chillers:`

  - Get cooling loop that chiller servers: `chw_loop_b = chiller_b.cooling_loop`

    - Add chiller rated capacity to CHW loop total capacity: `chw_loop_capacity_dict[chw_loop_b] += chiller_b.rated_capacity`

- For each primary CHW loop: `for loop_b_id in primary_secondary_loop_dictionary["PRIMARY"]:`

  - Check if CHW loop total cooling capacity is less than 300 tons, set target secondary pump type to riding the pump curve: `if chw_loop_capacity_dict[loop_b_id] < 300 * CONVERSION(TON_TO_BTUH): target_secondary_pump_type == "FIXED_SPEED"`

  - Else, set target secondary pump type to variable speed: `else: target_secondary_pump_type == "VARIABLE_SPEED"`

  - Get primary loop: `primary_loop_b = get_component_by_id(loop_b_id)`

    - For each secondary loop served by primary CHW loop: `for secondary_loop_id_b in primary_loop_b.child_loops:`

      - For each secondary pump associated with secondary loop: `for secondary_pump in loop_pump_dictionary[secondary_loop_id_b]:`

        **Rule Assertion - Component:**

        - Case 1: If secondary pump is modeled as riding the pump curve for a CHW system with a cooling capacity less than 300 ton, or modeled with a VFD for a CHW system with a cooling capacity of 300 ton or more: `if secondary_pump.speed_control == target_secondary_pump_type: PASS`

        - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`
