# Chiller - Rule 22-35  

**Rule ID:** 22-35  
**Rule Description:** Baseline systems served by purchased chilled water shall not be modeled with chilled water reset  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMI = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 Chiller  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** G3.1.3.9  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.25 

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMI

**Manual Check:** Yes  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. check_purchased_chw_hhw()


**Applicability Checks:**

- Check if B-RMI is modeled with purchased chilled water or purchased hot water/steam: `purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict = check_purchased_chw_hhw(B_RMI)`

  - If B-RMI is modeled with purchased cooling, rule is applicable, continue to rule logic: `if purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_COOLING"]: CHECK_RULE_LOGIC`

  - Else, rule not applicable: `else: RULE_NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  


**Rule Assertion:**

- Case 1:  `UNDETERMINED and raise_message "B-RMI IS MODELED WITH PURCHASED COOLING. VERIFY PURCHASED CHILLED WATER IS NOT MODELED WITH CHILLED WATER RESET."`
