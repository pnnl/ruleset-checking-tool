# Section 11 - SHW - Rule 11-3
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-3  
**Rule Description:** Where no service water-heating system exists or has been designed and submitted with design documents but the building will have service water-heating loads, a service water-heating system shall be modeled that matches the system type in the baseline building design  
**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE  
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1.11(c)  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** RMD  

**Applicability Checks:** Check that the User model doesn't have any ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment, and that the user model has at least one ServiceWaterHeatingUse

**Function Calls:** None  
  
## Applicability:   
- look for ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment in the user model: `if len(U_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment) > 0:`
    - look for ServiceWaterHeatingUse in the spaces in the proposed model: `for space in U_RMD:`
        - check for any service_water_heating_uses in the space: `if len(space.service_water_heating_uses) > 0: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
- if the program reaches this line without going to the rule logic, the project is not applicable: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
  
## Rule Logic:   
- create a variable that describes the type of SHW system found and initialize it by setting it to NONE: `shw_system_found = "NONE"`
- now look for ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment in the P_RMD - we want to find exactly one system per building

  **Rule Assertion:** 

  - Case 1: 
  - Case 2:
