# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-14  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.37  
**Mandatory Rule:** TRUE  
**Rule ID:** 11-14  
**Rule Description:** Where recirculation pumps are used to ensure prompt availability of service water-heating at the end use, the energy consumption of such pumps shall be calculated explicitly.    
**Rule Assertion:** UNDETERMINED / NOT_APPLICABLE
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, (f)

**Evaluation Context:** ServiceWaterHeatingDistributionSystem  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:** 
- **get_SWH_uses_associated_with_each_building_segment**
- **get_swh_components_associated_with_each_swh_distribution_system**  
- **get_component_by_id**  

## Applicability Checks:  
- All service water heating distribution systems with water uses are applicable
- get a dictionary all of the components associated with the swh distribution system in the building: `swh_comps_dict = get_swh_components_associated_with_each_swh_distribution_system(B_RMD)`
- look at each service water heating distribution system in the baseline model: `for swh_dist_sys in B_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems:`
    - look at the uses associated with this distribution system: `for swh_use_id in swh_comps_dict[swh_dist_sys.id]["USES"]:`
        - get the swh_use using get_component_by_ID: `swh_use = get_component_by_ID(P_RMD, swh_use_id)`
        - check to see if the use has SWH loads: `if swh_use.use > 0:`
            - the rule is applicable: `CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
      
    
    ## Rule Logic:  
    - for a hard pass, we're looking for all of the loops to recirculate, and have pumps with power > 0
    - an undetermined result would be if there is not recirculation (perhaps there should be recirculation), or if only some of the loops meet the criteria for a pass
    - a fail would be if the loops recirculate but don't have pumps or pump power
    - create a dictionary to keep track of the piping, and pumps attached to the distribution system: `piping_info = {}`
    - look at each piping connected to the distribution system: `for piping_id in in swh_comps_dict[swh_dist_sys.id]["PIPING"]:`
        - get the piping: `piping = get_component_by_id(B_RMD,ServiceWaterPiping)`
        - create a dictionary to store data about this piping: `piping_info[piping_id] = {}`
        - add the recirculation loop information to the dictionary: `piping_info[piping_id]["IS_RECIRC"] = piping.is_recirculation_loop`
        - if the piping is a recirculation loop, get the attached pump: `if(piping.is_recirculation_loop):`
            - need to look at each pump to see if it's connected: `for pump_id in swh_comps_dict[swh_dist_sys.id]["PUMP"]:`
                - get the pump: `pump = get_component_by_id(B_RMD,PUMP)`
                - if the pump loop_or_piping matches the current piping, add the pump to the piping dictionary: `piping_info[piping_id]["PUMP_POWER"] = pump.design_electric_power`
    - GO TO RULE LOGIC
 
    ## Rule Logic:
    - Case1: all piping are recirculating and pump power is > 0, PASS: `if all(entry.get("IS_RECIRC") and entry.get("PUMP_POWER", 0) > 0 for entry in piping_info.values()): PASS`
    - Case2: there is at least one piping that has recirculation, but no pump power, FAIL: `elif any(entry.get("IS_RECIRC") and entry.get("PUMP_POWER", 0) == 0 for entry in hash.values()): FAIL`
    - Case3: All others, UNDETERMINED: `UNDETERMINED`
