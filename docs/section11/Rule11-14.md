# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-14  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  

**Mandatory Rule:** FALSE  

**Rule ID:** 11-14  

**Rule Description:** "Where recirculation pumps are used to ensure prompt availability of service water-heating at the end use, the energy consumption of such pumps shall be calculated explicitly."  

**Rule Assertion:** UNDETERMINED / NOT_APPLICABLE

**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, (f)

**Evaluation Context:** B_RMD - each building
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:** 
- NONE

**Applicability Checks:**
- check that there is SWH in the proposed model AND that the building has a 24hr operating schedule

## Applicability Checks:
- look at each building in the RMD: `for building in B_RMD:`
    - create a boolean is_applicable and set it to false: `is_applicable = false`
    - look at each space in the building: `for space in P_RMD.building...:`
        - check to see if there is at least one SWH use associated with the space: `if len(space.service_water_heating_uses) > 0:`
            - the rule is applicable: `is_applicable = true`
      
    
    ## Rule Assertion:
    - if the boolean is_applicable is equal to true, the rule is applicable, return UNDETERMINED and a note letting the reviewer know what to check: `if is_applicable: UNDETERMINED raise_message: "This building has service water heating loads.  Where recirculation pumps are used to ensure prompt availability of service water-heating at the end use, the energy consumption of such pumps shall be calculated explicitly."`
    - otherwise, rule is not applicable: `else: NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Notes:  
1. is this an appropriate applicability check?  We could check for recirculation pumps in the proposed design, but given that this rule is evaluated just once per building, I think it's ok to have this rule get flagged for all buildings with SWH
