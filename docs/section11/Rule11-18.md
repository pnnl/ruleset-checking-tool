# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-8
**Schema Version:** 0.0.37  

**Mandatory Rule:** TRUE

**Rule ID:** 11-18

**Rule Description:** "Hot-water pumps shall only be enabled when a load exists on the associated hot-water loop"

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL

**Appendix G Section Reference:** G3.2.3.5  

**Evaluation Context:** each ServiceWaterPiping.  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**  
- **get_component_by_id**  
- **get_swh_components_associated_with_each_swh_distribution_system**  

## Applicability Checks:
- get the list of equipment connected to each SWH distribution system: `swh_and_equip_dict = get_swh_components_associated_with_each_swh_distribution_system(B_RMD)`
- look at each ServiceWaterHeatingDistribution system in the dictionary: `for swh_dist_sys_id in swh_and_equip_dict:`
  - We are only interested in piping that has a pump attached, so look at each pump id in the pump list: `for swh_pump_id in swh_and_equip_dict[swh_dist_sys_id]["Pumps"]:`
    - get the pump object using the id: `swh_pump = get_component_by_id(swh_piping_id, ServiceWaterPiping, B_RMD)`
    - get the piping associated with the pump: `piping = swh_pump.loop_or_piping`
    - go to rule logic: `GO TO RULE LOGIC`
- if we get here, the rule is not applicable: `NOT APPLICABLE`

  ## Rule Logic #
      - We need to look at the FluidLoopOperationOptions, which is referenced in the piping FluidLoopDesignAndControl.  First, get the piping design and control: `piping_design_and_control = piping.service_water_heating_design_and_control`
      - get the FluidLoopOperationOptions: `fluid_operation_options = piping_design_and_control.operation`
      - go to rule Assertion: `GO TO RULE ASSERTION`   
  ## Rule Assertion: 
      - Case1: if the fluid operation operation options is INTERMITTENT, PASS: `if fluid_operation_options == "INTERMITTENT": PASS`
      - Case2: all other cases, FAIL: `else: FAIL`


**Notes**:  
1.  FluidLoopDesignAndControl is not currently connected to ServiceWaterPiping.  We requested a new field for ServiceWaterPiping (service_water_heating_design_and_control).  (https://github.com/open229/ruleset-model-description-schema/issues/305)
