# Section 11 - SHW - Rule 11-3
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-3  
**Rule Description:** Where no service water-heating system exists or has been designed and submitted with design documents but the building will have service water-heating loads, a service water-heating system shall be modeled that matches the system type in the baseline building design  
**Rule Assertion:** Options are Pass/Fail/NOT_APPLICABLE  
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1.11(c)  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** RMD  

**Applicability Checks:** Check that the User model doesn't have any ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment, and that the user model has at least one ServiceWaterHeatingUse

**Function Calls:** None  
  
## Applicability:   
- look for ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment in the user model: `if len(U_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment) > 0:`
    - look for ServiceWaterHeatingUse in the spaces in the proposed model: `for space in U_RMD:`
        - check for any service_water_heating_uses in the space: `if len(space.service_water_heating_uses) > 0: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
- if the program reaches this line without going to the rule logic, the project is not applicable: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Rule Logic:  

- create a boolean to keep track of whether everything matches: `all_match = TRUE`
- create an error string: `error_str = ""`
- create the compare context string: `compare_context_str = "AppG 11-3 P_RMD Equals B_RMD"`
- check if the ServiceWaterHeatingDistributionSystem matches between the propoesd and user models.  First check whether there are the same number of systems: `if len(P_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems) == len(B_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems):`
    - look at each SHW distribution system in the proposed model and see if there is one that is the same in the user model.  This check relies on the understanding that the RCT team has a method for comparing all elements within an object match (compare_context_pair): `for p_SHW_dist_system in P_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems:`
        - if this system is in B_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems, compare the systems: `if p_SHW_dist_system in B_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems:`
            - use compare_context_pair to compare systems and set all_match to FALSE if the systems don't compare: `if !compare_context_pair(p_SHW_dist_system, B_RMD.get_component_by_id(p_SHW_dist_system.id),$,extra_schema_for_SHW_comparison.json,true,compare_context_str,error_str): all_match = FALSE`
        - otherwise, set all_match to false: `else: all_match = FALSE`
- otherwise, all_match is false: `all_match = FALSE`
- continue if all_match is still true: `if all_match:`
    - do the same comparison for ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment in the proposed and user models: `if len(P_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems) == len(B_RMD.service_water_heating_distribution_systems):`
        - look at each SHW system in the proposed model and see if there is one that is the same in the user model.  This check relies on the understanding that the RCT team has a method for comparing all elements within an object match (compare_context_pair): `for p_SHW_equipment in P_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment:`
              - use compare_context_pair to compare systems and set all_match to FALSE if the systems don't compare: `if !compare_context_pair(p_SHW_equipment, B_RMD.get_component_by_id(p_SHW_equipment.id),$,extra_schema_for_SHW_comparison.json,true,compare_context_str,error_str): all_match = FALSE`
        - otherwise, set all_match to false: `else: all_match = FALSE`
    - otherwise, all_match is false: `all_match = FALSE`
 
- we also need to compare the pumps connected to the DHW system, but not all pumps in the models are DHW pumps.  Create a list of the SHW pumps `shw_pumps_list = []`
- Iterate through the pumps in the proposed model: `for pump_p in P_RMI.pumps:`
    - check that the pump is connected to a ServiceWaterPiping object: `if type(pump_p.loop_or_piping) == ServiceWaterPiping:`
        - add the pump to the SHW pumps list: `shw_pumps_list.append(pump_p.id)`
- Iterate through the pumps in the user model: `for pump_b in B_RMD.pumps:`
    - check that the pump is connected to a ServiceWaterPiping object: `if type(pump_b.loop_or_piping) == ServiceWaterPiping:`
        - add the pump to the SHW pumps list: `shw_pumps_list.append(pump_b.id)`
- Iterate through the pump ids in the shw pumps list: `for pump_id in set(shw_pumps_list):`
    - find the pump in the proposed model: `pump_p = get_component_by_id(pump_id, P_RMD)`
    - find the pump in the user model: `pump_b = get_component_by_id(pump_id, B_RMD)`
    - if both pump_p and pump_u exist, we compare them using compare_context_pair: `if !compare_context_pair(pump_p, pump_b,$,extra_schema_for_SHW_comparison.json,true,compare_context_str,error_str): all_match = FALSE`
    - otherwise, the pump exists in only one of the two models, set all_match to false: `all_match = FALSE`

## Rule Assertion: 
- Case1: all elements are equal: PASS: `if all_match: PASS`
- Case2: all elements don't match, FAIL: if !all_match: FAIL`




  **Rule Assertion:**
  - if all_match is TRUE, then return PASS: `if all_match: return PASS`
  - if all_match is FALSE, return FAIL, one of the elements does not match, provide the error_str from the compare_context_pair function: `if not all_match: return FAIL; note = error_str`
  
  
  **Notes:**
  1.  using compare_context_pair might not be the correct approach - this function requires data elements in the extra schema to have a tag "AppG P_RMD Equals U_RMD" - is it possible to pass in a custom json created for this rule which identifies which elements need to be equal?
  2.  using compare_context_pair - how are sub-components like [{Tank}] (in ServiceWaterHeatingDistributionSystem) and {Tank} (in SolarThermal and ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment) evaluated? - also {Pump} and {ServiceWaterPiping}
