# ServiceWaterHeating - Rule 11-16

**Schema Version:** 0.0.37  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-16  

**Rule Description:** "Gas water heaters shall be modeled using natural gas as their fuel.  Exceptions: Where natural gas is not available for the proposed building site, as determined by the rating authority, gas water heaters shall be modeled using propane as their fuel."  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, (h)  

**Evaluation Context:** Each SWH Equipment  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**
- get_fuels_modeled_in_RMD


**Applicability Checks:**
- look at each SHW Equipment: `for swh_eq in B_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment:`
  - if the fuel source is electricity, the rule is not applicable: `if shw_eq.heater_fuel_type == "ELECTRICITY": NOT_APPLICABLE`
  - otherwise, continue to rule logic: `CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
  
    ## Rule Logic:
    - create variable heater_fuel_type: `heater_fuel_type = swh_eq.heater_fuel_type`
    - use the function get_fuels_modled_in_RMR to get a list of the fuels used in the proposed model: `proposed_fuels = get_fuels_modeled_in_RMD(P_RMD)`

    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - CASE 1: if the fuel source is NATURAL_GAS, then PASS: `if heater_fuel_type == "NATURAL_GAS": PASS`
    - Case 2: Else if the fuel source is propane and any of the proposed fuel sources is NATURAL_GAS, then FAIL: `if fuel_source == "PROPANE" && "NATURAL_GAS".in proposed_fuels: FAIL and raise_message "The fuel source for the baseline is propane, however the fuel source for the proposed is Natural Gas.  When natural gas is available on-site, natural gas is the required fuel source for the baseline model."`
    - Case 3: Else if the fuel source is propane, then UNDETERMINED: `if heater_fuel_type == "PROPANE": UNDETERMINED raise_message "The baseline service water heating has propane as a fuel source.  Natural gas is the required fuel source for the baseline model except in cases where natural gas is not available on-site.  Verify that natural gas is not available for the proposed building site as determined by the rating authority."`
    - Case 4: All others fail: `else: FAIL`


**Notes:**

1. original language specified gas storage water heaters only.  The rule applies only to gas storage water heaters because "storage" type water heaters are the only valid baseline fossil-fuel water heaters.  However, the heater type is checked in another rule.  Can we just check fuel-type here?
