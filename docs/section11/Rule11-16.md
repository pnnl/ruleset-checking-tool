# ServiceWaterHeating - Rule 11-16

**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-16  

**Rule Description:** "Gas water heaters shall be modeled using natural gas as their fuel.  Exceptions: Where natural gas is not available for the proposed building site, as determined by the rating authority, gas water heaters shall be modeled using propane as their fuel."  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, (h)  

**Evaluation Context:** Each SWH Equipment  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**


**Applicability Checks:**
- look at each SHW Equipment: `for swh_eq in B_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment:`
  - if the fuel source is electricity, the rule is not applicable: `if shw_eq.heater_fuel_type == "ELECTRICITY": NOT_APPLICABLE`
  - otherwise, continue to rule logic: `
  - `CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
    ## Rule Logic:
    - create variable heater_fuel_type: `heater_fuel_type = swh_eq.heater_fuel_type`
    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - CASE 1: if the fuel source is NATURAL_GAS, then PASS: `if heater_fuel_type == "NATURAL_GAS": PASS`
    - Case 2: Else if the fuel source is propane: `elif: heater_fuel_type == "PROPANE": UNDETERMINED and raise_message "BASELINE SERVICE WATER HEATING EQUIPMENT SOURCE IS MODELED AS PROPANE. VERIFY IF NATURAL GAS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE PROPOSED BUILDING SITE AS DETERMINED BY THE RATING AUTHORITY."`
    - Case 3: All others fail: `else: FAIL`

     **Rule Assertion - Zone:**
    - Case1: rule_status is PASS: `if rule_status == "PASS": PASS`.
    - Case2: rule_status is UNDETERMINED, UNDETERMINED & return rule_note: `elsif rule_status == "UNDETERMINED": UNDETERMINED; rule_note`
    - Case3: rule_status is FAIL, FAIL & return rule_note: `elsif rule_status == "FAIL": FAIL; rule_note`


**Notes:**

1. original language specified gas storage water heaters only.  The rule applies only to gas storage water heaters because "storage" type water heaters are the only valid baseline fossil-fuel water heaters.  However, the heater type is checked in another rule.  Can we just check fuel-type here?
