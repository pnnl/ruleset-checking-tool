# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-13  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  

**Mandatory Rule:** FALSE  

**Rule ID:** 11-13  

**Rule Description:** "Service water-heating energy consumption shall be calculated explicitly based upon the volume of service water heating required and the entering makeup water and the leaving service water-heating temperatures. Entering water temperatures shall be estimated based upon the location. Leaving temperatures shall be based upon the end-use  requirements."  

**Rule Assertion:** UNDETERMINED / NOT_APPLICABLE  

**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, (e)  

**Evaluation Context:** B_RMD - each building  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**  
- **get_spaces_associated_with_each_SWH_bat**  
- **ge_component_by_id**  

## Applicability Checks:  
- look at each building in the RMD: `for building in B_RMD:`
    - create a boolean is_applicable and set it to false: `is_applicable = false`
    - look at each building segment in the building: `for building_segment in building.building_segments:`
    - get the service water heating uses in the building segment `service_water_heating_use_ids = get_SWH_uses_associated_with_each_building_segment(P_RMD, building_segment.id)`
    - look at each service water heating use id: `for swh_use_id in service_water_heating_use_ids:`
        - get the swh_use using get_component_by_ID: `swh_use = get_component_by_ID(P_RMD, swh_use_id)`
        - check to see if the use has SWH loads: `if swh_use.use > 0:`
            - the rule is applicable: `is_applicable = true`
      
    
    ## Rule Assertion:
    - if the boolean is_applicable is equal to true, the rule is applicable, return UNDETERMINED and a note letting the reviewer know what to check: `if is_applicable: UNDETERMINED raise_message: "This building has service water heating loads.  Confirm that service water heating energy consumption is calculated explicitly based upon the volume of service water heating required and the entering makeup water and leaving service water heating temperatures.  Entering water temperatures shall be estimated based upon the location. Leaving temperatures shall be based upon the end-use  requirements."`
    - otherwise, rule is not applicable: `else: NOT_APPLICABLE`
