# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-11  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.37  

**Mandatory Rule:** TRUE

**Rule ID:** 11-11  

**Rule Description:** For buildings that will have no service water-heating loads, no service water-heating shall be modeled in baseline building model

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL/NOT_APPLICABLE

**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, c

**Evaluation Context:** B-RMD each building segment
**Data Lookup:**   

**Function Call:** 
- **get_component_by_id**  
- **get_SWH_components_associated_with_each_swh_bat**  
- **get_SWH_types_and_SWH_use**  
- **get_SWH_uses_associated_with_each_building_segment**  

**Applicability Checks:**

- look at each building segment in the proposed model: `for building_segment in P_RMD.building.building_segments:`
    - create a boolean has_swh_loads and set it to false: `has_swh_loads = false`
    - get the service water heating uses in the proposed building segment `service_water_heating_use_ids = get_swh_uses_associated_with_each_building_segment(P_RMD, building_segment.id)`
    - look at each service water heating use id: `for swh_use_id in service_water_heating_use_ids:`
        - get the swh_use using get_component_by_ID: `swh_use = get_component_by_ID(P_RMD, swh_use_id)`
        - check to see if the swh use is greater than 0 (ie there is any amount of hot water used): `if swh_use.use > 0:`
            - set has_swh_loads to true: `has_swh_loads = true`

    - if we arrive here with has_swh_loads still equal to false, CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC: `if has_swh_loads == FALSE: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
    - otherwise, the rule is not applicable: `else: NOT_APPLICABLE`

    ## Rule Logic: 
    - look at the same building segment in the baseline model, and make sure that there are no SWH loads in the baseline model
    - create a boolean has_swh_loads and set it to false: `has_swh_loads_b = false`
    - get the service water heating uses in the building segment `service_water_heating_use_ids = get_swh_uses_associated_with_each_building_segment(B_RMD, building_segment.id)`
    - look at each service water heating use id: `for swh_use_id_b in service_water_heating_use_ids:`
        - get the swh_use_b using get_component_by_ID: `swh_use_b = get_component_by_ID(B_RMD, swh_use_id_b)`
        - check to see if the swh use is greater than 0 (ie there is any amount of hot water used): `if swh_use_b.use > 0:`
            - set has_swh_loads to true: `has_swh_loads_b = true`

## Rule Assertion: 
- Case1: the baseline doesn't have any SWH use loads: PASS: `if !has_swh_loads_b: PASS`
- Case2: all other cases is a fail: `else: FAIL`
