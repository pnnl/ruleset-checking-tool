# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-12
**Schema Version:** 0.0.37  

**Mandatory Rule:** FALSE

**Rule ID:** 11-12  

**Rule Description:** "For large, 24-hour-per-day facilities that meet the prescriptive criteria for use of condenser heat recovery systems described in Section 6.5.6.2, a system meeting the requirements of that section shall be included in the baseline building design regardless of the exceptions to Section 6.5.6.2."  

**Rule Assertion:** UNDETERMINED / NOT_APPLICABLE

**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, d + exception

**Evaluation Context:** B_RMD - each building  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**  
- **get_component_by_id**  

**Applicability Checks:**
- check that there is SWH in the proposed model AND that the building has a 24hr operating schedule

## Applicability Checks:
- set the hours_this_year to 8760: `hours_this_year = 8760`
- if the calendar is_leap_year, then we need to add 24 hours to hours_this_year: `if RMD.calendar.is_leap_year: hours_this_year = hours_this_year +24`
- look at each building in the RMD: `for building in B_RMD:`
    - create a boolean is_applicable and set it to false: `is_applicable = false`
    - check to see if the building is operational 24hrs/ day, every day of the year.  Start by getting the building_open_schedule: `operation_schedule = building.building_open_schedule`
    - check to see if the schedule is operating 24hrs per day, all days per year: `if sum(operation_schedule.hourly_values) == hours_this_year:`
      - only projects with SWH in the proposed model are interpreted as having SWH loads.  A building must both have SWH loads and a 24hr operating schedule for this rule to be applicable.
      - look at each building segment in the building: `for building_segment in building.building_segments:`
        - get the service water heating uses in the building segment `service_water_heating_use_ids = get_SWH_uses_associated_with_each_building_segment(P_RMD)`
        - look at each service water heating use id: `for swh_use_id in service_water_heating_use_ids:`
            - get the swh_use using get_component_by_ID: `swh_use = get_component_by_ID(P_RMD, swh_use_id)`
            - check to see if the use has SWH loads: `if swh_use.use > 0:`
                - the rule is applicable: `is_applicable = true`
      
    
    ## Rule Assertion:
    - if the boolean is_applicable is equal to true, the rule is applicable, return UNDETERMINED and a note letting the reviewer know what to check: `if is_applicable: UNDETERMINED raise_message: "This building is a 24hr-facility with service water heating loads. If the building meets the prescriptive criteria for use of condenser heat recovery systems described in 90.1 Section 6.5.6.2, a system meeting the requirements of that section shall be included in the baseline building design regardless of the exceptions to Section 6.5.6.2. (Exceptions:
1. Facilities that employ condenser heat recovery for space heating with a heat recovery design exceeding 30% of the peak water-cooled condenser load at design conditions.
2. Facilities that provide 60% of their service water heating from site-solar energy or siterecovered energy or from other sources.)
   Recommend manual review to determine if project complies."`
    - otherwise, rule is not applicable: `else: NOT_APPLICABLE`
