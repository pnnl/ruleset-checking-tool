# Service_Water_Heating - Rule 11-11  
**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  

**Mandatory Rule:** TRUE

**Rule ID:** 11-11  

**Rule Description:** For buildings that will have no service water-heating loads, no service water-heating shall be modeled in baseline building model

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL

**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, c

**Evaluation Context:** B-RMD each SWH BAT
**Data Lookup:**   

**Function Call:** 
- **get_component_by_id**
- **get_SHW_equipment_connected_to_use_type**  
- **get_SHW_types_and_SHW_use**

**Applicability Checks:**
- Each SHW use type is applicable if there are NO SHW loads
- call the function get_SHW_equipment_connected_to_use_type for the baseline: `shw_bat_dict_b = get_SHW_equipment_connected_to_use_type(B_RMD)`
- call the function get_SHW_types_and_SHW_use for the proposed: `shw_bat_and_use_dict_p = get_SHW_types_and_SHW_use(P_RMD)`
- look through each of the SHW bats in the building: `for shw_bat in shw_bat_and_use_dict_p:`
  - check if there are SHW loads in this use type, not applicable: `if len(shw_bat_and_use_dict_p[shw_bat]) > 0: NOT_APPLICABLE`
  - otherwise, continue to rule logic for this shw_bat: `else: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`

  ## Rule Logic: 
  - check that there is either NO ENTRY in shw_bat_dict_b for the shw_bat OR that for each item in shw_bat_dict_b[shw_bat] that there are 0 items in the list:
  - set a variable result equal to FAIL: `result = PASS`
  - check if shw_bat_dict_b[shw_bat] is a dictionary.  If it's not, there is no entry (no equipment) for this shw_bat.  If it is, we need to make sure that there is no shw equipment of any type (distribution, equipment, pumps, etc) connected to the shw_bat: `if type(shw_bat_dict_b[shw_bat]) == 'dict':`
    - look at each of the different types of equipment (distribution, equipment, pumps, loops etc): `for shw_equip_type in shw_bat_dict_b[shw_bat]:`
      - for each of these, there should be a list.  If the list length is greater than 0, there is equipment here and we set result to FAIL: `if len(shw_bat_dict_b[shw_bat][shw_equip_type])> 0: result = FAIL`


## Rule Assertion: 
- Case1: result is pass: PASS: `if result == PASS: PASS`
- Case2: all other cases is a fail: `else: FAIL`
