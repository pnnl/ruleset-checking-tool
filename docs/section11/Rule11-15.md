# ServiceWaterHeating - Rule 11-15

**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-15  

**Rule Description:** "Service water loads and use shall be the same for both the proposed design and baseline building design and shall be documented by the calculation procedures described in Section 7.4.1.
Exceptions: 
(1) ECMs are used to reduce SWH use.. 
(2) SWH energy consumption can be demonstrated to be reduced by reducing the required temperature of service mixed water, by increasing the temperature, or by increasing the temperature of the entering makeup water. "  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, (g)  

**Evaluation Context:** Each SWH use  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**

1. get_component_by_id()

**Applicability Checks:**
- Each SHW use is applicable
- look at each space in the proposed building: `for space in B_RMD...spaces:`
  - look at each SWH use in the space, continue to rule logic: `for swh_use_p in space.service_water_heating_uses: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`

    ## Rule Logic:
    - get the baseline equivalent swh use: `swh_use_b = get_component_by_id(swh_use_p.id, B_RMD)`
    - create a value to track the rule status: `rule_status = "PASS"`
    - create a variable to track any notes: `rule_note = """`
    - check that swh_use_b exists, if it does, continue with rule logic: `if swh_use_b != null:`
      - check that the use matches by checking that the use, use_units, use_multiplier_schedule, and temperature_at_fixture all match (ARE THERE OTHERS THAT NEED TO MATCH TOO?)
      - check use_units, if not equal, set to fail and add a note indicating that the use units are different: `if swh_use_p.use_units != swh_use_b.use_units: rule_status = "FAIL"; rule_note += "Service water heating use units are inconsistent between proposed and baseline models.  "`
      - check use_multiplier_schedule, if not equal set to fail and append a note indicating that the use_multiplier_schedules don't match: `if swh_use_p.use_multiplier_schedule != swh_use_b.use_multiplier_schedule: rule_status = "FAIL"; rule_note += " Service Water Heating Use schedules do not match.  "`
      - now, if the rule_status is still "PASS", we'll check if the use is equal or not between proposed and baseline: `if rule_status == "PASS":`
        - check whether the proposed use is less than the baseline, this will result in UNDETERMINED as an ECM could reduce swh use due to low-flow fixtures.  Change rule_status and append note: `if swh_use_p.use < swh_use_b.use: rule_status = "UNDETERMINED"; rule_note += "Proposed Service Water Heating Use is less than the baseline.  Manually verify that reduction is due to an ECM that reduces service water heating use, such as low-flow fixtures.  "`
        - otherwise, if the proposed use is greater than the baseline, the result is fail.  Append a note: `if swh_use_p.use > swh_use_b.use: rule_status = "FAIL"; rule_note += "Proposed Service Water Heating Use is greater than the baseline.  "`

     **Rule Assertion - Zone:**
    - Case1: rule_status is PASS: `if rule_status == "PASS": PASS`.
    - Case2: rule_status is UNDETERMINED, UNDETERMINED & return rule_note: `elsif rule_status == "UNDETERMINED": UNDETERMINED; rule_note`
    - Case3: rule_status is FAIL, FAIL & return rule_note: `elsif rule_status == "FAIL": FAIL; rule_note`


**Notes:**

1. comparison is done expecting each element (use, use_units, schedule) to match individually instead of calculating yearly total.  This means that systems using POWER type use_units can be evaluated
