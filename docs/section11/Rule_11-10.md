# ServiceWaterHeating - Rule 11-10

**Schema Version:** 0.0.37  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-10  

**Rule Description:** The service water heating system type in the baseline building design shall match the minimum efficiency requirements in Section 7.4.2  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, a + b  

**Evaluation Context:** Each ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**

1. get_SHW_equipment_associated_with_each_SWH_bat()

**Applicability Checks:**
- Each SHW Equipment is applicable
- look at each SHW equipment in the building: `for swh_eq in B_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment:`
  - CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC
- there are no cases where a Service Water Heating Equipment is not applicable to the rule
- if there are no SWH equipment in the RMD, then this rule is not applicable: `if(len(B_RMD.service_water_heating_equipment) == 0): NOT APPLICABLE`


    ## Rule Logic:
  - create a value to track the rule status: `rule_status = "FAIL"`
  - create a variable to track any notes: `rule_note = ""`
  - we need to find the following information about the SWH:
    - swh_type - one of the ServiceWaterHeaterTankOptions
    - input_capacity (btu/hr)
    - storage_volume (gallons)
    - draw_pattern (VERY_SMALL, LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH)
    - capacity_per_volume (btu/hr/gallon)
  - get the service water heating system: `swh_eq = get_object_by_id(service_water_heating_equipment_id,RMD)`
  - get the type of tank: `tank_type = swh_eq.tank.type`
  - the swh_type will be one of the ServiceWaterHeaterTankOptions, which are more detailed than the four types we need.  Determine our type based on the detailed type.
  - the default value of swh_type is OTHER.  If the swh_type can be identified, the value will be changed in the logic below: `swh_type = "OTHER"`
  - if the tank_type is CONSUMER_INSTANTANEOUS, COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS, or RESIDENTIAL_DUTY_COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS, set the swh_type to INSTANTANEOUS and go to rule assertion: `if tank_type in ["CONSUMER_INSTANTANEOUS", "COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS", "RESIDENTIAL_DUTY_COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS"]: swh_type = "INSTANTANEOUS"`; GO TO RULE_ASSERTION

  - get the fuel type of the equipment: `fuel_type = shw_eq.heater_fuel_type`
  - if the tank_type is CONSUMER_STORAGE or COMMERCIAL_STORAGE, set the swh_type to STORAGE for the fuel type: `if tank_type in ["CONSUMER_STORAGE", "COMMERCIAL_STORAGE"]:`
    - set the swh_type based on tank_type and fuel type: `if fuel_type == "ELECTRICITY": swh_type = "ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_STORAGE`
    - `elif fuel_type == "NATURAL_GAS": swh_type = "GAS_STORAGE`
    - if the fuel type is propane, this is treated as natural gas in Table 7.8: `elif fuel_type == "PROPANE": swh_type = "GAS_STORAGE"`
    - if the fuel type is not Electricity, Natural Gas, or Propane, this is not a valid baseline SWH system.  Create a rule note and go directly to the rule assertion: `else: rule_note += "Fuel type: " + fuel_type + " is not a valid fuel type for a service water heating baseline system.  According to ASHRAE 90.1 Table G3.1.1-2 service water heating equipment shall be either electric resistance or natural gas.  According to ASHRAE 90.1 Table G3.1 #11 h, in cases where natural gas is specified as the baseline system, but there is no natural gas available on site, a propane system may be modeled.  "; rule_status = FAIL; GO TO RULE ASSERTION `
  - if the draw_pattern is given, get the draw pattern: `if shw_eq.draw_pattern != null: draw_pattern = shw_eq.draw_pattern`
  - otherwise, determine the draw pattern based off the first_hour_rating of the shw_eq: `else:`
    - First get the first hour rating (gallons): `first_hour_rating = shw_eq.first_hour_rating`
    - if the first_hour_rating is less than 18 gallons, draw_pattern is "VERY SMALL": `if first_hour_rating < 18: draw_pattern = "VERY_SMALL"`
    - otherwise if the first_hour_rating is less than 51 gallons, draw pattern is LOW: `elif first_hour_rating < 51: draw_pattern = "LOW"`
    - otherwise if the first_hour_rating is less than 75 gallons, draw pattern is MEDIUM: `elif first_hour_rating < 75: draw_pattern = "MEDIUM"`
    - otherwise draw pattern is HIGH: `else: draw_pattern = "HIGH"`
  - get the capacity of the SHW system (make sure to convert to btu/hr): `input_capacity = swh_eq.input_power`
  - get the volume of the tank (make sure to convert to gallons): `storage_volume = swh_eq.tank.storage_capacity`
  - calculate the capacity_per_volume based on the rated_capacity and the storage_volume: `capacity_per_volume = shw_eq.rated_capacity / storage_volume`
  - get the efficiency metric values: `efficiency_metric_values = swh_eq.efficiency_metric_values`
  - get the efficiency metric types: `efficiency_metric_types = swh_eq.efficiency_metric_types`
  - create a dictionary of the efficiency data: `efficiency_metric_dict = dict(zip(efficiency_metric_types, efficiency_metric_values))
  - get the thermal efficiency: `thermal_efficiency = efficiency_metric_dict["THERMAL_EFFICIENCY"]`
  - get the uniform energy factor: `uniform_energy_factor = efficiency_metric_dict["UNIFORM_ENERGY_FACTOR"]`
  - what follows is logic that implements Table 7.8 - this table has multiple criteria, so I think it's simpler to implement with if / else logic than a table lookup
  - if the swh_type is OTHER, set rule_note to "Water heater type is not a recognized type", and continue to rule assertion: `if swh_type == "OTHER": rule_note = "Water heater type is not a recognized type"; rule_status = FAIL; GO TO RULE ASSERTION`
  - create a boolean has_fault and set it to false: `has_fault = false`

  - check the size of the storage tank.  If it's less than 20 gallons, provide a note, and continue to rule assertion: `if storage_volume < 20: rule_note += "  The storage tank volume is less than 20 gallons and based on the size categories in ASHRAE 90.1 Table 7.8 and in 10 CFR 430, it would not be classified as a storage water heater.

   **Rule Assertion - ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment:**
  - Case1: swh_type is INSTANTANEOUS - there is no baseline instantaneous water heater types: `if swh_type == "INSTANTANEOUS": UNDETERMINED; rule_note += "  There baseline water heater is of an Instantaneous type. Only electric resistance and gas storage water heaters are applicable to the Appendix G baseline acccording to Table G3.1 #11 Baseline Building Performance column and Table G3.1.1-2. Consequently, the efficiency of the modeled water heater was not assessed."`
  - Case2: rule_status is PASS: `if rule_status == "PASS": PASS`.
  - Case3: rule_status is UNDETERMINED, UNDETERMINED & return rule_note: `elif rule_status == "UNDETERMINED": UNDETERMINED; rule_note`
  - Case4: rule_status is FAIL, FAIL & return rule_note: `elif rule_status == "FAIL": FAIL; rule_note`


**Notes:**

1. standby loss calculated based on https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/CBECC-Res_UserManual_2019.2.0_ada.pdf 9.6.4.8
2. what category to use of fuel type is Propane? Gas or Oil?
3. how to calculate the subcategory or rating condition (btu/hr/gallon) to confirm that this requirement is met?
4. draw_pattern - not currently included in the schema, but could be inferred from first_hour_rating based on Table I on page 9: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2016-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2016-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appE.pdf
5. This question was discussed on 5/29/2024 and agreed that this exception wouldn't be triggered by a baseline system.  Original question: Would the exception to 7.4.2 ever be applicable to a baseline system?  The exceptions is: "All water heaters and hot-water supply boilers having more than 140 gal of storage capacity are not required to meet the standby loss (SL) requirements of Table 7.8 when 
    1. the tank surface is thermally insulated to R-12.5,
    2. a standing pilot light is not installed, and
    3. gas- or oil-fired storage water heaters have a flue damper or fan-assisted combustion.
6. Written assuming the issue: https://github.com/open229/ruleset-model-description-schema/issues/287 will be accepted as part of the schema
