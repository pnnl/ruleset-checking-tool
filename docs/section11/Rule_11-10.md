# HVAC_SystemZoneAssignment - Rule 11-10

**Schema Version:** 0.0.36  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 11-10  

**Rule Description:** "The service water heating systems type in the baseline building design shall match the minimum efficiency requirements in Section 7.4.2"  

**Rule Assertion:** Options are PASS/FAIL/NOT_APPLICABLE/UNDETERMINED  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Table G3.1 #11, baseline column, a + b  

**Evaluation Context:** Each SWH bat  
**Data Lookup:**   
**Function Call:**

1. get_SHW_equipment_connected_to_use_type()
2. get_SHW_types_and_SHW_use()

**Applicability Checks:**
- Each SHW use type is applicable if there are SHW loads
- use get_SHW_equipment_associated_with_each_SWH_bat to get the SHW use types and SHW use in the building: `shw_bats_and_equip_dict = get_SHW_equipment_associated_with_each_SWH_bat(B_RMD)`

- call the function get_SHW_types_and_SHW_use for the proposed: `shw_bat_and_use_dict_p = get_SHW_types_and_SHW_use(P_RMD)`
- look through each of the SHW bats in the building: `for shw_bat in shw_bat_and_use_dict_p:`
  - check if there are SHW loads in this use type, continue to rule logic: `if len(shw_bat_and_use_dict_p[shw_bat]) > 0: CONTINUE TO RULE LOGIC`
  - otherwise, rule is not applicable for this shw_bat: `else: NOT_APPLICABLE`


    ## Rule Logic:
  - create a value to track the rule status: `rule_status = "FAIL"`
  - create a variable to track any notes: `rule_note = """`
  - there should be one SHW Equipment for this space type: `if len(shw_types_and_use_dict[shw_bat]["SHWHeatingEq"]) != 1:`
    - set rule_note to "more than one ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment" `rule_note = "more than one ServiceWaterHeatingEquipment"`
  - otherwise, do the calculations to figure out of the SWH equipment meets the requirements of the rule: `else:`
    - get the service water heating equipment id: `service_water_heating_equipment_id = shw_equip_dict[shw_bat]["SHWHeatingEq"]`
    - we need to find the following information about the SWH:
      - tank_type - (ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_INSTANTANEOUS, ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_STORAGE, GAS_STORAGE, OTHER)
      - input_capacity (btu/hr)
      - storage_volume (gallons)
      - draw_pattern (VERY_SMALL, LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH)
      - capacity_per_volume (btu/hr/gallon)
    - get the service water heating system: `swh_eq = get_object_by_id(service_water_heating_equipment_id,RMD)`
    - get the type of service water heating system: `shw_type = swh_eq.type`
    - the type will be one of the ServiceWaterHeaterTankOptions, which are more detailed than the four types we need.  Determine our type based on the detailed type.
    - set the type to OTHER.  If the shw_type is an identifiable type, type will be overwritten to that type: `type = "OTHER"`
    - if the shw_type is CONSUMER_INSTANTANEOUS, COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS, or RESIDENTIAL_DUTY_COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS, set the type to INSTANTANEOUS: `if shw_type in ["CONSUMER_INSTANTANEOUS", "COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS", "RESIDENTIAL_DUTY_COMMERCIAL_INSTANTANEOUS"]: type = "INSTANTANEOUS"`
    - if the shw_type is CONSUMER_STORAGE or COMMERCIAL_STORAGE, set the type to STORAGE: `if shw_type in ["CONSUMER_STORAGE", "COMMERCIAL_STORAGE"]: type = "STORAGE"`
    - get the fuel type of the equipment: `fuel_type = shw_eq.heater_fuel_type`
    - set the type based on shw_type and fuel type: `if fuel_type == "ELECTRICITY":`
      - `if shw_type == "INSTANTANEOUS": type = "ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_INSTANTANEOUS"`
      - `elsif shw_type == "STORAGE": type = "ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_STORAGE"`
    - `elsif fule_type == "NATURAL_GAS":`
      - `if shw_type == "INSTANTANEOUS": type = "GAS_INSTANTANEOUS"`
      - `elsif shw_type == "STORAGE": type = "GAS_STORAGE"`
    - `elsif fule_type == "FUEL_OIL":`
      - `if shw_type == "INSTANTANEOUS": type = "OIL_INSTANTANEOUS"`
      - `elsif shw_type == "STORAGE": type = "OIL_STORAGE"`
    - if the draw_pattern is given, get the draw pattern: `if shw_eq.draw_pattern != nil: draw_pattern = shw_eq.draw_pattern`
    - otherwise, determine the draw pattern based off the first_hour_rating of the shw_eq: `else:`
      - First get the first hour rating (gallons): `first_hour_rating = shw_eq.first_hour_rating`
      - if the first_hour_rating is less than 18 gallons, draw_pattern is "VERY SMALL": `if first_hour_rating < 18: draw_pattern = "VERY_SMALL"`
      - otherwise if the first_hour_rating is less than 51 gallons, draw pattern is LOW: `elsif first_hour_rating < 51: draw_pattern = "LOW"`
      - otherwise if the first_hour_rating is less than 75 gallons, draw pattern is MEDIUM: `elsif first_hour_rating < 75: draw_pattern = "MEDIUM"`
      - otherwise draw pattern is HIGH: `else: draw_pattern = "HIGH"`
    - get the capacity of the SHW system (make sure to convert to btu/hr): `input_capacity = swh_eq.input_power`
    - get the volume of the tank (make sure to convert to gallons): `storage_volume = swh_eq.distribution_system.tank.storage_capacity`
    - calculate the capacity_per_volume based on the input_capacity and the storage_volume: `capacity_per_volume = shw_eq.rated_capacity / storage_volume`
    - get the standby loss (see note 1 for calculation source): `standby_loss = swh_eq.standby_loss_fraction * 8.25 * volume * 70`
    - what follows is logic that implements Table 7.8 - this table has multiple criteria, so I think it's simpler to implement with if / else logic than a table lookup
    - if the type is OTHER, set rule_note to "Water heater type is not a recognized type": `if type == "OTHER": rule_note = "Water heater type is not a recognized type"`
    - otherwise, continue with rule logic: `else:`
      - create a boolean has_fault and set it to false: `has_fault = false`
      - if the water heater is electric resistance, or storage and the capacity is <= 12kW (40945 btu/hr), then the standard doesn't cover it: `if type in ["ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_INSTANTANEOUS", "ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_STORAGE"] && input_capacity <= 40945.7:`
        - set rule_note to: `rule_note = "Water heaters or gas pool heaters in this category or subcategory are regulated as consumer products by the USDOE as defined in 10 CFR 430."`
        - set rule_status to UNDETERMINED: `rule_status = "UNDETERMINED"`
      - otherwise, continue with rule logic: `else:`
        - check electric storage water heaters with capacity greater than 12 kW: `if type == "ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_STORAGE" && input_capacity > 40945.7:`
          - check that the capacity_per_volume < 4000 btu/hr/gallon: `if capacity_per_volume < 4000:`
            - calculate the standby loss target: `standby_loss_target = 0.3 + (27/swh_eq.distribution_system.tank.storage_volume)` 
            
            - if the standby_loss is less than or equal to the target, set the rule_status to PASS: `if standby_loss <= standby_loss_target: rule_status: "PASS"`
            - otherwise: `else:`
              - set the note to indicate that the standby_loss is higher than the maximum allowed: `rule_note = "Standby Loss is higher than required by Table 7.8"`
          - otherwise: `else:`
            - set the note to indicate that the capacity per volume exceeds the limit: `rule_note = "Capacity per volume exceeds the limit of 4000 btu/hr/gallon for Electric Storage Water Heaters` 
        - check if the water heater is an instantaneous electric resistance: `if type == "ELECTRIC_RESISTANCE_INSTANTANEOUS"`
          - check the capacity.  If it's less than or equal to 58.6 kW (199951.5 btu/hr), check the other parameters.  We don't need to check if the capacity is > 12 kW, because all systems less than 12 kW have already been checked: `if input_capacity <= 199951.5:`
            - the storage capacity should be less than or equal to 2 gallons: `if storage_volume > 2:`

    - Case3: rule_status is FAIL, FAIL & return rule_note: `elsif rule_status == "FAIL": FAIL; rule_note`


**Notes:**

1. standby loss calculated based on https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/CBECC-Res_UserManual_2019.2.0_ada.pdf 9.6.4.8
2. what category to use of fuel type is Propane? Gas or Oil?
3. how to calculate the subcategory or rating condition (btu/hr/gallon) to confirm that this requirement is met?
4. draw_pattern - not currently included in the schema, but could be inferred from first_hour_rating based on Table I on page 9: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2016-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2016-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appE.pdf
5. Would the exception to 7.4.2 ever be applicable to a baseline system?  The exceptions is: "All water heaters and hot-water supply boilers having more than 140 gal of storage capacity are not required to meet the standby loss (SL) requirements of Table 7.8 when 
    1. the tank surface is thermally insulated to R-12.5,
    2. a standing pilot light is not installed, and
    3. gas- or oil-fired storage water heaters have a flue damper or fan-assisted combustion.
