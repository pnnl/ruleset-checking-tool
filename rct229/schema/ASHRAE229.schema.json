For submissions where the software always produces all ruleset model descriptions together, multiple model descriptions would appear in the same ASHRAE229 ruleset project description json file. Some rulesets may restrict the submission process including the number of files and number of model descriptions per file. Multiple model descriptions may be required by rulesets that require models at various tiers or levels of performance. Model descriptions may also be used by References between data groups and are restricted to be within the same ruleset model description. For 90.1-2019 appendix G model descriptions would be created for the following models: user, proposed, baseline at 0 degrees, baseline at 90 degrees, baseline at 180 degrees, and baseline at 270 degrees. All IDs within a ruleset model description should be unique for each type of data group. Between ruleset model descriptions, IDs should be the same for the same component. For example, a Surface with an ID of LobbyFrontSurface is very likely to have the same geometry for all ruleset model descriptions except perhaps the azimuth so that surface should have the ID LobbyFrontSurface for all ruleset model descriptions."

For example, if five dwelling units facing the same orientation are modeled as a single zone, the total volume of the zone and the total surface area of the zone should be five times the values of a single dwelling unit shown on the design documents and aggregation_factor should be set to 5. Another example, when three identical floors are modeled, the zones modeled for these floors should represent the volume of the zone on three floors, and the aggregation_factor should be set to 3. A final example would be a big box retail store with eight units serving the core zone, the total floor area of the spaces in the core zone should already account for the total area, and the aggregation_factor should be set to 8. The factor is chiefly used to determine the size range for heating and cooling equipment serving that zone. Used only to confirm the individual size of heating or cooling units serving the zone so that the efficiency for that size range can be looked up in tables of equipment efficiency by size range. By dividing the heating and cooling capacity of the zone by the aggregation_factor, the result would indicate the capacity of the individual units represented by equipment. For zones not representing any type of aggregation, this value should be one. The aggregation_factor is typically an integer but occasionally may include a fractional value. The total area of the spaces and the volume of the zone should already be multiplied by the factor."
