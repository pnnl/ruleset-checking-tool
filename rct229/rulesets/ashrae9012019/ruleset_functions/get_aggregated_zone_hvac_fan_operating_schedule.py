    """
     This function loops through all of the HVAC system fan operating schedules associated with a specific zone and
     creates an aggregated fan operating schedule for the zone. More specifically, if any of the fan operating schedules
     associated with any of the hvac systems serving the zone have a 1 for a particular hour of the year then the aggregated schedule will equal 1
     for that particular hour of the year. The function will check this for each hour of the year and return an 8760 aggregated fan operating schedule.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rmd: dict A zone id associated with the RMR for which to create the aggregated fan operating schedule as described above.
    zone_id: str A zone id associated with the RMR for which to create the aggregated fan operating schedule as described above.
    is_leap_year: bool, indicate whether the comparison is in a leap year or not. True / False


    Returns
    ----------
    aggregated_zone_hvac_fan_operating_schedule: 8760 aggregated fan operating schedule for the zone.
