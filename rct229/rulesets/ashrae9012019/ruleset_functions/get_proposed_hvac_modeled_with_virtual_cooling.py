def get_proposed_hvac_modeled_with_virtual_cooling(rmi_u, rmi_p):
    """

    Get the list of HeatingVentilatingAirconditioningSystem in which Appendix G Table G3.1 #10 d is applicable (i.e.
    space cooling is modeled in the P_RMR but not the U_RMR). Table G3.1 #10 d states that "where no cooling system
    exists or no cooling system has been submitted with design documents, the cooling system type shall be the same in
    the proposed as modeled in the baseline building design and shall comply with the requirements of Section 6."

    Parameters
    ----------
    rmi_u dict
        A dictionary representing a building as defined by the ASHRAE229 schema. The user RMI to determine if an
        HVAC system has been designed or is existing with cooling.
    rmi_p dict
        A dictionary representing a building as defined by the ASHRAE229 schema. The proposed RMI to determine if the
        same HVAC system has been modeled with cooling in the P-RMR.

        A list that saves all the HVAC systems in which Appendix G Table G3.1 #10 d are applicable (i.e. modeled with
        virtual cooling in the proposed).
