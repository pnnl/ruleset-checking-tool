        For a list-type rule, we need to create a list of contexts to pass on

        ----------

        This new data will be merged into the existing data dictionary by the

        This method is typically overridden to collect data available at this rule's
        level that is needed by some subrule.

        This default implementation checks for a data argument to the initializer being
        set. If set, the object is resolved as json pointers
        to extract the new data from context.

        If the new data is only one or more elements that can be obtained directly from
        context, then do not override this method; use the data initializer
        instead. Override this method if any calculations are required to obtain the
        new data.

        is returned from create_context_list.

        NOTE: when overriding this function, it is important to know that rmd scope for none-index rmd, could be NONE.
        It is recommended to add a NONE check for those rmd scope.
