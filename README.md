# Ruleset Checking Tool

Ruleset Checking Tool for ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2019 Appendix G

This package provides a reference implementation of a Ruleset Checking Tool (RCT) in support of ASHRAE Standard 229P.  The RCT is not intended to be a normative part of the proposed standard, so use with Std 229P is optional.  This RCT implementation is specific to ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2019 Appendix G and does not support any other rulesets.  Final release of this package is dependent upon acceptance and publication of ASHRAE Standard 229P.

## About ASHRAE 229P

ASHRAE Standard 229P is a proposed standard entitled, "Protocols for Evaluating Ruleset Implementation in Building Performance Modeling Software". To learn more about the title/scope/purpose and status of the proposed standard development visit the standards project committee site at [ASHRAE SPC 229](http://spc229.ashraepcs.org/).

## Introduction
The Ruleset Checking Tool is a Python package providing a command line tool for evaluating whether baseline and proposed Building Energy Models (BEM) meet the requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2019 Appendix G.  The tool accepts Ruleset Model Report (RMR) files representing the User, Baseline, and Proposed models as inputs, and generates an output report describing the RMR evalaution.
